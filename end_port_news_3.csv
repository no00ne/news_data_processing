428,183,Africa Finance Corporation Sells Stake in Takoradi Port Project,"Africa Finance Corporation (AFC) has sold its 35% equity share in Atlantic Terminal Services Ltd. (ATSL) to the port operator Yilport Holding.



 In 2019, AFC, an African development finance institution, committed to investing up to $138 million in equity and debt for the TAKORADI PORT Expansion project. The project, awarded to Yilport under a 25-year concession, entrusts them with responsibilities involving design, engineering, finance, and reconstruction of the terminal.



 While AFC has exited its equity position, it will continue to provide financial support to the project. Additionally, other stakeholders such as Ibistek and Ghana Ports & Harbours Authority remain actively involved.



 The primary objective of the Takoradi project is to modernize the port, streamlining the import and export processes in Ghana's western and central regions. The project when complete, will lead to increased efficiency, benefiting not only Ghana but also its neighboring landlocked countries.



TAKORADI PORT provides faster and less congested trade routes to the western and central regions of Ghana, making it a central and strategic hub for the neighboring landlocked nations. The Takoradi region also boasts numerous industrial areas, business parks, and a growing natural resources sector. Additionally, it also supports substantial agriculture, including being the source of 50% of Ghana's cocoa production.



 Yilport Holding's new acquisition signifies its entry into the African market. They plan to transform the port and its surrounding areas into a thriving trade and logistics center, thereby attracting significant traffic.



 AFC's recent completion of two new ports, Terminal à Conteneurs De Nouakchott and the San Pedro Multipurpose Industrial Terminal in Côte d’Ivoire within the past year, underscores their unwavering commitment to infrastructure development in the region.",2023-11-04,08:21:59,africa-finance-corporation-sells-stake-in-takoradi-port-proj,Ports,[],2023-11-04 08:21:59+00:00,[]

2210,1699,Port of Long Beach Achieves 2023 Emission Reduction Goal,"The Port of Long Beach has managed to successfully achieve all the 2023 emission reduction goals outlined in the San Pedro Bay Ports Clean Air Action Plan (CAAP). As per the US Port’s annual emission inventory report, there has been a decline of 62% in smog-forming nitrogen oxides, 90% in diesel soot, and a massive dip of 97% in Sulphur oxides. The annual emissions inventory is reviewed by South Coast Air Quality Management District, California Air Resources Board, and the US Environmental Protection Agency. The achievement was clocked when the container throughput increased by 21%.



 Celebrating the achievement, Steve Neal, Long Beach Harbor Commission President said that they are committed to their ultimate goal of becoming an emission-free port. Port of Long Beach explained that the pollution levels were with respect to the 2005 baseline, the year before the original San Pedro Bay CAAP was adopted.



 Though the achievement of Port of Long Beach is quite a success story, there is much more to it. The west coast of the US has been struggling with a severe supply chain crisis and has witnessed a record container traffic. The findings of FleetMon state that greenhouse gas emissions have increased, mainly due to the increased traffic and longer anchor stays of vessels. Between 2019 and 2020, there was a 7% increase in greenhouse gas emission attributed to several factors such as rise in cargo handling equipment, increased heavy-duty truck activity, etc.

2216,1705,Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles announce fine for container unloading delay,"Struggling with heavy backlogs and congestion at ports, the Port of Long Beach (POLB) and the Port of Los Angeles (POLA) have announced to impose a fine of 100 US dollars per day per container from shipping companies that unload cargo too slowly. Explaining the arrangement, the twin ports said that from 1st Nov, the arriving containers scheduled to be moved by trucks will be allowed to stay for 9 days and after that the fine would be collected from them. For the cargo scheduled to be moved by trains, the port stay for the containers would be only 3 days before the fine is applied.



 Mario Cordero, Executive Director of POLB said that terminals are running short on space and this move will make space for containers sitting on ships at anchor. The past month saw a number of steps taken by the port administration as well as government interventions to ease up the logjam of cargo ships that has crippled the global supply chain.



 The late fees collected from the stagnant cargo shippers will be reinvested in programs to enhance the efficiency and speed of cargo movement at these ports. It will also be used to address the impact of congestion throughout San Pedro Bay.



 This latest penalty-imposing policy was developed in coordination with the Biden-Harris Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force, the US Department of Transportations, and other supply chain stakeholders. John D. Porcari, Port Envoy to the Biden-Harris Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force supported the step taken by the twin ports and said that it will expedite the cargo movement at ports which would ultimately reduce congestion.

2254,1734,US Coast Guard investigates MSC Danit in Huntington oil spill case,"On Saturday 16th Oct, the US Coast Guard investigation team boarded cargo vessel MSC Danit in Long Beach to look for evidence in the Orange County oil spill case. The investigation team suspects that MSC Danit may have struck the San Pedro Bay pipeline in January 2021 which led to a chain of events resulting in the spill of estimated 25,000-130,000 gallons of crude oil into the sea near Orange County. FleetMon reported on the oil spill in early October.



 The theory believed by the investigators is that the underwater pipeline was hooked by an anchor of a large vessel and then the 4000-foot section of the pipe was dragged over a distance of 100 feet, ultimately breaking off the concrete outer casing of the line. Convinced with the proposed theory, Captain Jason Neubauer said that ROV inspection has suggested that the anchor strike must have occurred months ago or even a year in the past. His investigation team has focused on an unusual storm that had hit the area on January 24-25 this year which led to a lot of vessel management activity at the Marine Exchange VTS of San Pedro Bay.



 In the press release, Coast Guard has said that investigators determined that MSC Danit had dragged the anchor on January 25 during the heavy weather event. With its huge size and massive deadweight, the vessel fits in the Coast Guard’s suspected vessel’s criteria.



 FleetMon's AIS vessel tracking data shows the giant container vessel, MSC Danit to be moving erratically over the pipeline while anchored off the Port of Long Beach on January 24-25, 2021. The vessel had then departed to the west, away from the high winds along the east coast of Catalina Island.



 Vessel owner Dordellas Finance Corporation and vessel operator Mediterranean Shipping Company have been designated as “parties in interest” to the marine casualty investigation. Now the involved companies can cross-examine witnesses, retain lawyers and call their witnesses to support the inquiry. In the case, multiple damage scenarios are still being explored and additional vessels of interest are under investigation.",2021-10-19,11:39:21,us-coast-guard-investigates-msc-danit-in-huntington-oil-spil,Accidents,"[{'id': '1152', 'attributes': {'assetId': 420020, 'assetName': 'MSC DANIT', 'assetType': 'vessel'}}]",2021-10-19 11:39:21+00:00,[]
2291,1765,California pipeline oil spill case: Hapag Lloyd vessel comes under investigation,"US Coast Guard will be examining the Hapag Lloyd vessel Rotterdam Express in relation to the pipeline that was severed off near the coast of Southern California. It is being speculated that a ship's anchor might have damaged the pipeline that led to 3,000 barrels of crude flowing into the sea near Huntington Beach, south of Los Angeles on Sunday.



 The speculations are fueled by the US Coast Guard's initial investigation which revealed that a section of the pipeline was laterally displaced from its place by more than 30m. Hapag-Lloyd owned vessel, Rotterdam Express had anchored approximately 500m away from the pipeline when the oil spill was first detected, and later the vessel left for Oakland.



 A Hapag-Lloyd spokesperson explained that as per the direction of San Pedro  Traffic, Rotterdam Express had anchored at SF-3 anchorage on 21 September 2021. The vessel had dropped at the exact directed location and the same was confirmed by San Pedro Traffic.



 Hapag Lloyd said that their vessel Rotterdam Express did not move from anchorage nor did it pass over the pipeline. The company added that they are cooperating with the involved authorities. They also made clear that during anchorage no oil spill was detected.



 The area around Long Beach and Los Angeles has a very busy anchorage which simply means that USCG might have to check a long list of vessels to complete their investigation. Interestingly, the agency has not released any official statement blaming the anchor for the pipeline damage.



 CNN reported that the federal regulators have cited more than 100 violations by Beta Operating Company, the subsidiary of Amplify Energy and the operator of the pipeline in the last 11 years.



  Skyruth, a non-profit organization that uses satellite technology to identify environmental issues has said that Rotterdam Express was the vessel closest to the pipeline at the time of the spill. However, even if it was the closest, it was 500m away from the pipeline which reduces its chances of being the culprit.",2021-10-08,12:55:56,california-pipeline-oil-spill-case-hapag-lloyd-vessel-comes-,Maritime Security,"[{'id': '1170', 'attributes': {'assetId': 133290, 'assetName': 'AMSTERDAM EXPRESS', 'assetType': 'vessel'}}, {'id': '204', 'attributes': {'assetId': 87, 'assetName': 'LOS ANGELES', 'assetType': 'port'}}]",2021-10-08 12:55:56+00:00,[]
2320,1785,Los Angeles Experiences Relief From Congestions As Delays Skyrocket In Ports Worldwide,"The busiest US ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach have experienced a modest relief from congestion over the week. According to the statement released by Marine Exchange of Southern California on Monday, the number of vessels at anchorage in San Pedro Bay has reduced from 70 to 62, and a total of 33 vessels are berthed at the ports.



 The signs of relief were also accompanied by a warning by Danish shipping giant Maersk, which in its market update released on the same day predicted the congestions to persist through year-end.



 The California ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach have been witnessing a constant growth in vessel queues over the past month which reached an all-time high of more than 70 vessels waiting to dock on Friday. The recent reduction can be accounted for by the recourse of strategies implemented at the ports by expanding operating gate hours at night-time and during weekends for trucks.



 But the port authorities have termed the recent relaxation as temporary with an expected increase in the queue once again. According to the marine exchange, more than 19 container ships were expected to arrive at the San Pedro bay against just 12 vessels finding berthing space at the two ports over the weekend.



 Maersk noted that congestions have been worsening at several US ports owing to unprecedented demand levels. The turnaround time at the Port of Seattle had increased up to 11-12 days whereas on the East Coast with more than 30 vessels waiting to berth at port Savannah.



 The report said the successive port closures in Asia due to typhoons, hurricanes, and covid+19 outbreaks have nullified any progress made to resolve the delays. It believes the severity is determined by the projected growth in demand for containers in 2021 which has risen to an enormous 5-6%.



 The company emphasized the growing nature of delays shortly at various other US and Asian ports owing to strong demand for container shipping, which is expected to further strengthen due to China's Golden Week in October, Christmas, and Chinese New Year.

2376,1833,"Congestion Worsens at LA, Long Beach As A Record 56 Boxships Queue up","America's busiest ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach experience no relief from congestion as the queue of container ships keeps growing in the San Pedro Bay. According to Marine Exchange of Southern California, the situation at the adjacent ports has escalated dramatically with a record 56 vessels waiting for their turn.



 The congestion at the US west coast has been steadily growing from June through September. Currently, more than 31 container vessels are berthed at these two ports for availing cargo operations and the average anchorage time has risen to 8.5 days.



 The situation has arisen due to an extreme imbalance in import and export volumes at the ports owing to the irrational bolstering of inventories by shippers ahead of the holiday season.



 According to a press release by Dr. Johannes Schlingmeier, CEO of Container xChange, ""There is a 60% increase in the inbound outbound ratio at the ports of US West Coast,""



 By the end of the month, the number of ships at anchorage is expected to be double the number that can be handled by both the ports at any instance. The estimates by the Los Angeles port reveal an expected increase in import volumes of about 9.14% and 21.65%, over the next two weeks respectively, in comparison to the previous week.



 The growing queue of ships at anchorage is also becoming a cause of concern among environment protection authorities and groups. The large-scale underwater noise pollution and damage to the seabed are likely to disturb marine ecology in the region. Increased dumping of waste and release of emissions is also expected to deteriorate air and water quality.



 These congestions are expected to translate into severe fiscal losses with disruption of trade and supply chain. According to Russell group estimates the disruption could affect trade worth $90 billion.



 The upcoming golden week holidays in China during the first week of October might bring some temporary relief to the ports with an increase in blank sailings, but to fix the crisis there is still a long way to go.

2657,2061,"Los Angeles Hits a New Milestone, 10M Containers Processed in a Year","Riding the growth wave in imports, the Port of Los Angeles has reached the epitome height where it has processed 10 million containers in a year. In the Western Hemisphere, the Port of Los Angeles has become the first port to attain this milestone and the same was marked with a ceremony on 9 June 2021. It is expected by 30 June, when the port will be completing its fiscal year 2020-2021 it would have processed more than 10.8 million TEUs. These surge in numbers crunch a growth percentage of 17 percent in volumes.



 As per the port officials, the rise in the container volume can be attributed to pandemic-induced consumer buying. When the pandemic restrictions were eased last year, the consumer buying surge happened and it has continued. This consumer buying surge started the chain of restocking the retail outlet shelves and e-commerce warehouses throughout the USA.



 For the last twelve months, Port of Los Angeles has handled an average of 15 containerships per day which is 50% up from the pre-pandemic average. Jamie Lee, President of the Los Angeles Board of Harbor Commissioners, picturized the massive scale of operation by saying that if the 10 million containers are stacked end-to-end, they will circle the world one and half a time. He further extended his gratitude towards the terminal operators, shipping line partners, truckers, longshore workers, and other stakeholders for achieving this remarkable feat during the hours of a pandemic.



 The past year has not been easy for the Port of Los Angeles. The rush of containers had strained the resources at the port and by the beginning of the year 2021, there were visible bottlenecks and congestion at the port. At one point in time, there were as many as 60 ships anchored in San Pedro Bay and the waiting time for ships to berth at terminals had hit 10 days. Port dedicated resources to manage this deadlock and finally has brought down the waiting time to 4.9 days.



 In the coming weeks, the Port of Los Angeles might face a dip in container inflow due to congestions happening in China. Despite challenges, Gene Seroka, Port Executive Director has a very optimistic outlook and he predicts a strong future. He says that the infrastructure investments and the supply chain digitization will present opportunities to build on the high growth of the port.

With volumes predicted to remain at a peak for April too, container ships are expected to be stuck at anchor till June.



 Port of Los Angeles Executive Director Gene Seroka was in exuberance in a press conference on Wednesday. Describing last month’s import streams as “remarkable” and a “once-in-a-lifetime event”, he said, “I would describe this as the port version of March Madness.""



 Container volumes handled in March were up by 113% on a year-on-year basis, handling 957,599 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) in the process. This was the highest number for March in the port's extensive history.







 Seroka exclaimed, “If those containers were placed end to end they’d stretch from Los Angeles to New York and halfway back across the country.""



 “That’s a big number for a peak month like September or October. But we’ve never seen volume like this in the first half of the year,"" he added.



 Ships at Anchorage:



 However, high traffic at port is not good news for vessel owners. A lot of noise has been raised by industry insiders on the vessel congestion in California’s San Pedro Bay.



 As of today, 30 container ships are waiting to dock in Los Angeles and Long Beach. Thirty-five container ships are at anchorage. FleetMon's vessel tracking platform can provide deep insights here.



 The peak number reached on February 1st when 40 ships were at anchorage.



 Commenting on the increased pileup of containerships in California and Long Beach, the executive director of the Marine Exchange of Southern California, Mr. Kip Louttit said,  ""We seem to have settled into a new, new normal of roughly 30 container ships at anchor.

 Mostly promoted as ""America's Port"", the Port of Los Angeles is managed by the Los Angeles Harbor Department.



 “One year ago global trade slowed to a crawl as the COVID-19 pandemic first hit China and then spread worldwide,” said Port of Los Angeles Executive Director Gene Seroka.



 He added, "" Today, we are in the seventh month of an unparalleled import surge, driven by unprecedented demands by American consumers.""



 Stressing on the vaccination drive that frontline maritime workers, especially those working in and out of the port complex desperately need, he said, “Our challenges now are focused on getting port workers vaccinated and assisting stakeholders in managing this heavy flow of cargo.""



 He also added that the port authorities would do everything in their power for helping shipping lines back on schedule.



 ""We must clear the backlog of cargo and return more certainty to the Pacific trade,” he said.



 February 2021 loaded imports entered 412,884 TEUs when compared to the previous year.  On the other hand, loaded exports decreased 24.7% to 101,208 TEUs. Empty containers, heavily in demand in Asia, surged 104% compared to February 2020 reaching 285,223 TEUs.
