602,351,Passenger Overboard Incident Aboard the ‘Wonder of the Seas’ Cruise Ship,"A man has been reported overboard from the world's largest cruise ship, the ""WONDER OF THE SEAS."" This incident marks the fourth occurrence of a passenger overboard within two months.



 While en route to Mexico, on the 29th of August, around 8:00 PM, a man was reported overboard approximately 30 miles off the coast of the southern shore of Santiago de Cuba islands. In response to the man's overboard situation, the ship immediately executed a turn and launched a rescue boat to initiate a search for the individual.



 The ship's crew promptly initiated a comprehensive search and rescue operation, closely collaborating with local authorities. This operation used spotlights, a smaller vessel, and dedicated personnel to meticulously comb the area in search of the missing person. Over nearly three hours, the ship's crew diligently scoured the vicinity in their search for the individual.



 Regrettably, despite the extensive efforts, the search has not yielded any successful results thus far. At 11:30 PM, due to an unrelated onboard medical emergency, the ship's route was redirected from Cozumel to Grand Cayman. The ship undertook a swift journey to Grand Cayman to address this medical situation.



 Only limited information has been released regarding the specific details of the incident or the individual involved.



 This incident now marks the fourth occurrence of a passenger overboard within the past two months alone, bringing the total number of such incidents to 12 this year. Tragically, these incidents are the leading cause of fatalities on cruise ships.",2023-08-31,13:43:30,passenger-overboard-incident-aboard-the-wonder-of-the-seas-c,Cruises and Tourism,[],2023-08-31 13:43:30+00:00,[]
