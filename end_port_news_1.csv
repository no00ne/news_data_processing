36,11217,Barge Collision with Galveston Bridge Causes Oil Spill and Waterway Closure,"!A barge collided with the bridge 

On Wednesday, May 15, a barge collided with a bridge connecting Galveston, Texas, to Pelican Island. The incident occurred when a tugboat pushing the two barges lost its control and slammed the bridge, causing oil to spill into the water.


The Galveston County Office of Management stated that the barge collided with the bridge, causing parts of the bridge to fall onto the barge, leading to the closure of a section of the waterway. Moreover, an individual also fell from the barge into the water and was immediately rescued without any injuries and no casualties were reported.


The Galveston County spokesperson stated that the barge, which has a 30,000-gallon capacity, caused a 10.5-kilometer oil spill and disrupted the nearby waterway.


According to experts and analysts, the incident, which occurred miles away from the Houston Shipping Channel and the Gulf Intracoastal waterway, an essential route for vessels, is unlikely to cause major economic disruption.

80,11171,"Ship collides with pier of Jiujiang Bridge in China, Four People Missing","!Vessel
On April 23, 2024, merchant vessel XIN RONG HAI 1 that was heading towards Danganzhou Tailwater crashed into the Jiujiang Bridge on the G240 National Highway in South China's Guangdong Province.The collision with the bridge resulted in the sinking of the vessel.

At 09:20 pm local time, the ship hit one of the pillars of the bridge which led to the flooding of the cargo hold. By 11:40 pm local time, due to excessive flooding the vessel sunk into the river. 

Local media has reported that seven of the eleven crew members were rescued in the overnight rescue operation, however four crew members are still missing. The Chinese local government coordinated the maritime, fishery, and rescue forces, dispatching 32 vessels, and more than 400 personnel for search and rescue of 4 missing crew members.

As of now, there is no clarity about the real cause, but blames have been put up on improper vessel operations due to the flooding from upstream and strong currents in the river. The area has been experiencing heavy rain since the weekend. Local media has reported that around 10 people are missing due to flooding in the area. Traffic police in Guangdong Province are on high alert and Chinese officials are inspecting the bridge for safety checks.

The Department of Marine has suspended all navigational activities within the 3 kilometres around the bridge. All the vessels have been ordered to take alternate routes, except for the rescue boats.

The vessel XIN RONG HAI 1, registered under Fuzhou was loaded with 4900 tonnes of rolled steel.The vessel was sailing from Heshan city enroute to FUZHOU.

113,11138,Denmark Bans Open-Loop Scrubber Discharges to Protect Marine Environment,"!Denmark bans scrubber tower discharge to sea
The Danish government has joined the growing number of nations taking action against open-loop scrubbers. From July 1, 2025, ships equipped with open-loop scrubbers will be prohibited from sailing closer than 22 kilometers from Danish coastlines. The government has secured a ""broad political agreement"" to ban the release of washwater from scrubbers into Danish seas.

Scrubbers became widespread after the implementation of strict sulphur rules in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea in 2015, and particularly after worldwide sulphur regulations went into effect in 2020. The shipping industry then had two options for adhering to the new rules: using a scrubber to remove the sulphur smoke or using fuel with less sulphur.

According to the Danish Environmental Ministry, scrubber discharges have been linked to excessive levels of a number of heavy metals and tar substances in the marine environment. Subsequently, the ban of open-loop scrubbers in Danish waters could reduce significant discharge of nickel into the sea by up to 20% and anthracene by 7%.

Environment Minister Magnus Heunicke stated that the Broad Political Agreement banning open-loop scrubbers is a crucial step for a healthier marine environment. Many harmful compounds released by scrubber water build up on the bottom, are absorbed into the ocean's food systems, and eventually find their way into the seafood we eat.

Following this, the ban on closed-loop scrubber discharge will be implemented in July 2029. The agreement also marked the intention to pursue the same ban under the regional maritime convention in the Baltic Sea and North Sea.

Apart from Denmark, there are other countries including China, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and many European ports, which have already banned the use of open-loop scrubbers.",2024-04-12,10:19:35,denmark-bans-open-loop-scrubber-discharges-to-protect-marine,Regulatory,"[{'id': '6808', 'attributes': {'assetId': 170, 'assetName': 'COPENHAGEN', 'assetType': 'port'}}, {'id': '8720', 'attributes': {'assetId': 377, 'assetName': 'ESBJERG', 'assetType': 'port'}}]",2024-04-12 10:19:35.757000+00:00,[]

 The funding for this project will be provided by the US Development and Finance Corporation (DFC). DFC is partnering with Sri Lankan company John Kells Holdings and the Indian-based Adani Ports & Special Economic Zones Limited, which owns a 51% share and is leading the development of the terminal.



 The PORT OF COLOMBO serves as the busiest transshipment hub in the Indian Ocean and has been operating at over 90% capacity since 2021, highlighting the urgent need for additional capacity and new terminals.



 In September 2021, Adani Ports signed a $700 million agreement with the Sri Lanka Ports Authority and the local conglomerate John Kells Holdings to collaboratively develop the terminal. This project follows the build-operate-transfer model and is set to span over 35 years.



 Once completed, the terminal is expected to generate a substantial number of new jobs, not only in Colombo but across Sri Lanka, significantly bolstering the economy.



 The US Development and Finance Corporation, established in 2019, is often seen as a countermeasure to China's Belt and Road Initiative. China has been heavily involved in the development of ports, terminals, and infrastructure projects in Sri Lanka, including facilities in Colombo and Hambantota.

 Locally known as the ""Ada Modu,"" the ship will initially offer shorter cruises departing from Shanghai. It boasts an impressive 135,000 gross tons and measures 323.6 meters in length, providing 2,125 hotel rooms and accommodating up to 5,246 passengers.



 The ship's design is a product of collaboration between Carnival Corporation and Fincantieri, with Carnival's Vista class serving as the foundation for the design. Carnival and Fincantieri have been consultants to the China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC) since the shipbuilding project's inception in November 2018.



 The cruise ship boasts an array of amenities, including showrooms, lounges, a spacious shopping arcade, and 26 distinctive restaurants and bars. There's even a dedicated play area for children.



 Chinese authorities have highlighted the remarkable achievement of completing the construction project in just five years. They have cited this as a testament to the increasing sophistication of Chinese shipbuilding capabilities. A sister ship is also currently under construction.



 Notably, the vessel comprises 107 systems, 55,000 sets of equipment, 25 million components and parts, 4,750 kilometers of cable, 365 kilometers of pipelines, and 120 kilometers of air pipes.

423,178,Thailand cruise terminals projects: timing not good ,"There is no doubt, that Thailand is capable of constructing new cruise terminals of mega proportions, fitted with state-of-the art technologies. But there’s one serious doubt of those terminals viability. We live in turbulent times of deepening worldwide economy recession and political instability, with wars springing up in different regions of the world. Global consumer spending is on the decline, everywhere. Thailand economy is already suffering from decreasing export volumes to the US and EU, and worst is yet to come. Thailand industries and population are suffering from energy prices going off charts, as of recent. Same can be said about all the countries which were and are the main drivers of cruise tourism, such as US, Canada, EU, Australia, NZ. “Wait and see” is probably, the best option, for the time being.

Cruise ship terminal to be built in Pattaya for 7.4bn baht
  June 29, 2023
  The Marine Department will this year seek Cabinet approval to build Thailand’s first cruise ship terminal in Pattaya.
  The Marine Department will oversee development of the terminal, which will meet growing demand from cruise operators, a senior official said on Thursday.
  Wannachai Butrthongdee, director of the department’s Engineering Division, said the cruise ship terminal will be built under a public-private partnership (PPP) project worth 7.4 billion baht.
  The private contract winner will be handed a 30-year concession to operate the Pattaya cruise port, which will be built off the popular Bali Hai Pier.
  The pier currently serves tourists taking boats to the popular island of Koh Lan just off Pattaya.
  The number of cruise ship passengers this year is estimated at 31.5 million worldwide and is expected to grow to 36 million next year.
  Wannachai added that Asia remains the most popular destination for cruises, with Thailand the third most popular Asian destination among cruise ships.
  A Marine Department survey has identified a 1-kilometre site around Bali Hai Pier with potential to be developed into a modern cruise ship terminal. The new terminal will have capacity for two large cruise ships to dock at the same time.
  Wannachai said that Thailand receives about 500 cruise ships each year, but the lack of a special terminal means passengers must take small boats to travel ashore.
  He said the department also sees potential to build cruise ship terminals in Koh Samui, Surat Thani, and Krabi.
  Currently, cruise ships can dock at Bangkok Port and Laem Chabang Port, but both are commercial shipping ports and thus lack facilities for passengers.
  Wannachai said the department would submit its Pattaya terminal proposal to the Transport Ministry, State Enterprise Policy Office, and Cabinet this year.
  After cabinet approval, the department will draft a PPP contract next year and call for bids in 2025. Construction is due to begin in 2026 and be completed in 2029.
  Cruise ship terminal to be built in Pattaya for 7.4bn baht
  The budget of 7.412 billion will be divided into 5.934 billion baht for construction and 1.478 billion for operation and maintenance costs.
  Wannachai said the government will invest 5.534 billion to expropriate the land and construct docking facilities, a passenger building, docking bridge and car park.
  The private bid winner will invest 1.877 billion baht for operation and maintenance, including installing power and water supplies and purchasing equipment to operate the terminal.
  The investment yield rate will be 20% with investment recouped within an estimated 10 years.
  The project is already drawing interest from firms in Hong Kong and Singapore that specialise in marine and tourism operations, Wannachai said.
  The terminal’s double docking fronts, each stretching 420 metres, will allow simultaneous docking by large cruise ships.
  The passenger building will have capacity for 1,500 home port passengers per hour or 3,500 port-of-call passengers per hour, Wannachai said.

443,197,​  Turbulent times require realistic approach ,"After so many plans and projects and studies, new Thailand Government seems to make up its’ mind on a project of land bridge connecting Gulf of Siam and Andaman sea, instead of Kra Canal project. This decision – whether land bridge will be constructed or not – is definitely, much more comprehensive and wise if you will, than mega project of Kra Canal. Kra Canal was to be built basing mostly or solely, on Chinese investments and Chinese companies (on all stages, from designing to construction and later, exploitation) and Chinese labor. Rounding it all up, Canal bears too many risks of all kinds, from purely economical to national safety and security ones. 
 Here’s one more consideration to be taken into account – feasibility of Canal or Land Bridge, whatever, in turbulent times of apparent global economy recession; wars coming out of nowhere with no sensible explanation; growing tension in different regions of the world ripe with yet more wars; continuing and expanding “green policy”, which didn’t yet save the planet, but so far, is effectively ruining global and national economies. 
 There’s no risk of Malacca Strait overcrowded with heavy traffic, in dire need of bypass ways, but there’s growing risk of worldwide crisis. If things come to worst, nations with bigger rate of economical sustainability and independence will have much better chance of surviving hard times. Land Bridge certainly, is a project which will make Thailand economy more resilient.

 Srettha touts land bridge project Reworked vision does not include canal 
 26 Oct 2023 
 During a speech delivered yesterday at an Economic Reporters Association meeting, Mr Srettha said the project between the Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman Sea will reduce the transport time by 6-9 days, as well as cut logistics costs by bypassing congestion in the Malacca Strait.
 He said this version of the project, which has been rumoured about for four decades, will not dig a canal in the Kra Isthmus of Thailand, instead connecting the two coasts with infrastructure such as an oil pipeline to support the growth of complementary industries such as petrochemical factories and gas separation plants.
 ""This project would make Thailand an attractive country for investment,"" he said.
 ""The government will push for this project to be formed during our term.""
 Mr Srettha said the economy needs a major stimulus because over the past 10 years Thailand's GDP grew by only 1.8% per year on average, while household debt increased from 76% of GDP to 91% at present.
 Thailand has among the highest household debt-to-GDP ratios in Asia and ranks No.10 globally.
 He said some Thai workers in Israel chose not to return to Thailand because their salaries there are higher than they can earn here. This reflects the country's economic problems, said Mr Srettha.
 The government is trying to come up with measures to solve economic problems in the short, medium and long term, he said.
 Many multinational companies that want to relocate their production bases abroad are overlooking Thailand, not because of the proposed minimum wage hike from 400 to 600 baht, but rather the lack of infrastructure and FTAs, he said.
 Thailand's minimum wage over the past decade increased by only 12%, from 300 to 337 baht per day, said Mr Srettha.
 He said attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) is another important component of the nation's economic development.
 In less than two months since taking office, Mr Srettha has visited several countries and invited foreign companies to invest in Thailand, particularly 10 large Chinese conglomerates.
 On his next business mission abroad, he said he will bring along a delegation from the private sector.
 Mr Srettha emphasised investment in infrastructure is very important as he wants to see Thailand become a hub for manufacturing FDI.
 The Thai economy has expanded at a slower pace recently than the economies of Vietnam, Indonesia and Malaysia, said Mr Srettha.
 ""However, the government is also proceeding with FTA negotiations and supporting the land bridge project.""

 Land Bridge instead of Canal
 August 2021
 Thailand Ministry of Transport still cherishes the idea as a part of Southern Economic Corridor Project. Provinces homing relevant ports and Kra Isthmus land links connecting these ports, are also enthusiastic. Chumphon Province along Gulf of Siam coast, and Ranong Province on the other side of the Isthmus, will benefit greatly from Land Bridge, if it’s materializes and lives up to cargo volumes expectations.
 Links to connect 2 ports aren’t restricted to highways and railways, understood project implies construction of pipeline, because project suggests oil transportation as well – and in big volumes.
 The Chumphon-Ranong land bridge project will serve as a link for the transport of oil from the Strait of Hormuz, more than 4,000 kilometers away from the Andaman Sea, to a port in Ranong before it is transported by land to a port in Chumphon, where it will be shipped to other countries in the region, including China, Japan and South Korea, Transport Minister Saksayam Chidchob said.
 Oil, indeed, is supposed to constitute the major part of cargo volumes to flow through Land Bridge, so crude oil tankers are to become the main type of ships to call Bridge ports.

 Direct sea route Thailand – Bangladesh under FTA Agreement
 January 2020
 Bangladesh is Thailand’s third-largest trade partner in South Asia after India and Pakistan, with annual bilateral trade worth $1.25 billion in 2018, down 4.4% from the previous year.
 So far, Thailand is having a significant trade surplus, with exports to Bangladesh amounting to $1.2 billion and imports worth just $59.24 million.
 Thailand exports from Bangladesh cement, plastic pellets, chemical products, textiles, steel, tapioca products, air conditioners, cosmetics, and automobiles and parts; importing a small amount of garments, scientific and medical gear, fresh and frozen aquatic animals, and machinery and parts.
 Thailand’s direct investment in Bangladesh totalled $1.5 billion from 2006 to 2019, mainly in agriculture and processed agricultural industries, construction, and hotels and related services, while Bangladesh’s investment in Thailand was worth $1.12 million during the period.
 All import/export goods are transported to/from Bangkok and Laem Chabang ports, via transit ports in Malaysia, mainly Port Klang, and Singapore, delivery time being some 7-12 days.
 There is an alternative route, which excludes transit ports and transshipments, project being mulled over for quite some time. It’s a direct route between Chittagong Port and Thailand’s Port of Ranong in Andaman sea. Delivery time will be shortened to some 5 days. This project was also discussed during 5th Joint Trade Committee (JTC) meeting, and both sides agreed it has to be expedited.

What’s obvious from just watching traffic on Thai highways and in cities, is growing number of Chinese EVs. They’re a new trend, gathering popularity among middle class people mostly, if not exclusively. People in rural areas, farmers first of all, truck drivers, others deployed in economy and infrastructure activities, not surprisingly, stick to good old ICE cars, of Japanese brands and Thailand making, long proven high-quality, reliable and economically feasible vehicles. When will the EV trend run out and restrict itself to big cities only, is a question of near future, considering electricity cost, which starting Spring this year, hit the roof, with yet no signs of going down.

Here’s a compilation of Car Carrier Services news starting Dec last year:

New car carrier line to connect China and Thailand. Probably.
Mikhail VoytenkoThailand December 18, 2022 
Chinese media announced official opening of new regular ro-ro route, set to connect China and Thailand. New line was launched with departure of China Merchants’ car carrier CHANG DA LONG from Ningbo on Dec 16, with more than 1,200 China-made cars on board, destined for Laem Chabang, Thailand. Two monthly trips are presently, on schedule, to be carried out by 2000-cars class DALONG car carrier.
Actually, according to track and port of destination, CHANG DA LONG is sailing to Nansha with ETA Dec 19. Then there is the question of practicality of the project, unless each car carrier trip back to China is to be with full load of Thailand-made Japanese Brand cars, of very good quality – Japan was importing Thailand-made cars after Fukushima disaster. Who is to buy Chinese cars in a country which produces all top Japanese car brands, is anyone’s guess, unless Chinese cars are to be sold at much lower prices.

Guangzhou Port adds new stop in Thailand to meet demand for Chinese cars
2023-10-12 09:27By： China Daily
At an automobile terminal of the Guangzhou Port in Nansha, Guangdong province, a vessel loaded with 2,291 units of automobiles was fully prepared to embark on the upgraded China-Thailand-Persian Gulf route on Thursday. 
To serve Chinese automakers entering the Thai market, the existing China-Persian Gulf line has been optimized and upgraded to include a stop in Thailand, forming a monthly China-Thailand-Persian Gulf route.
Facing the continuous growth of demand for Chinese automobiles in Southeast Asia, the new route will provide a secure, efficient, and stable supply chain guarantee for Chinese automobile exports, helping Chinese companies to expand overseas and achieve greater development in key markets. 
These latest exports reflect a strong handling capacity in automobile exports and imports at the Guangzhou Port over the past few months, according to the port authority. 
Guangzhou Port, one of the largest ports in terms of automobile handling capacity, exported 258,000 units of automobiles from January to September, with a year-on-year increase of 56 percent, according to the local port authority. 
Major automobile shipping companies have established international trade routes at the Guangzhou Port, which has core advantages in automobile roll-on/roll-off transportation, to meet the export needs of many domestic and foreign automobile companies, the port authority added. 
In 2017, the annual throughput of rolled-on/rolled-off automobiles at the port exceeded one million units and settled at a scale of 1.5 million units from 2020 to 2022. 
As one of the first designated ports for automobile imports in China, Guangzhou Port has built several berths and terminals since 2004, forming a large roll-on/roll-off operation pattern for handling automobiles. 
The port is a gateway for automobiles serving the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. It has 12 roll-on/roll-off berths and 2 million square meters of automobile storage yards. The port has an annual handling capacity of over 3 million units and a one-time storage capacity of over 80,000 units.

626,375,NYK Receives LNG-Powered ‘Sumire Leader’ PCTC From China Merchants Jinling Shipyard,"China Merchants Jinling Shipyard has successfully delivered the fourth and final LNG-powered Pure Car Truck Carrier (PCTC), named the ""SUMIRE LEADER,"" to NYK Shipping, a Japan-based maritime company. This delivery took place on August 14th. NYK Shipping has plans to place orders for an additional 12 PCTCs with similar specifications from Japanese shipyards starting in 2025.



 The ""SUMIRE LEADER"" is an impressive 7000 CEU car carrier. The construction of four such vessels was commissioned at China Merchants Jinling shipyard in 2020. The initial three vessels in this series were delivered earlier, with the first ship, the ""JASMINE LEADER,"" arriving earlier this year. The subsequent ships, the ""WILD ROSE LEADER"" in April and the ""FREESIA LEADER"" in July, completed the trio.



 With a length of 199 meters and a width of 38 meters, the ""SUMIRE LEADER"" stands out as one of the largest vessels in its class.



 Prominent environmentally conscious features have been seamlessly integrated into the ship's design. Foremost among these is its utilization of LNG as a power source. Other energy-efficient solutions, including hull modifications, are projected to contribute to an overall reduction of 99% in Sulfur Oxide compounds (Sox), a 96% decrease in nitrogen Oxide compounds (Nox), and a significant 40% decrease in CO2 emissions when compared to vessels reliant on Heavy Fuel Oil.



 NYK Shipping's strategy involves the incorporation of 40 new PCTC vessels into its existing fleet as it simultaneously phases out older ships. A paramount objective is to achieve a 50% reduction in CO2 emissions per kilometer of transport by 2050. NYK Shipping is also exploring the prospect of replacing LNG, currently a transitional fuel, with more sustainable alternatives such as Hydrogen or Ammonia.",2023-08-19,02:36:54,nyk-receives-lng-powered-sumire-leader-pctc-from-china-merch,General,[],2023-08-19 02:36:54+00:00,[]

 Carnival Cruise Line confirmed that on Sunday morning, July 23rd, a 30-year-old male named ""Jaylen Hill"" intentionally went overboard approximately 153 kilometers off the coast of Melbourne. The man's companion reported him missing to the crew after he had not been seen all day. The crew launched a search, and upon reviewing security footage, it was discovered that the man had intentionally jumped overboard.



 Upon confirming the passenger's disappearance, shore authorities were notified, and the US Coast Guard commenced a search operation. An Ocean Sentry plane from Miami, a Hercules aircraft from Clearwater, and the Coast Guard Cutter ""Tarpon"" searched an area of approximately 1,374 square miles but could not locate the man. The search has been called off for now, pending further developments.

696,446,VLCC Nautica Arrives in Yemen to Transfer Oil From Decaying FSO Safer,"The VLCC, ""NAUTICA,"" has arrived in Yemen to remove around a million barrels of oil from the decaying oil tanker, ""FSO Safer."" FSO Safer has been in a precarious condition due to a lack of maintenance and poses a significant risk of breaking apart or exploding.



 Yemen's Foreign Minister, Ahmed Bin Mubarak, confirmed the arrival of the VLCC NAUTICA, which has anchored at the Hodeida port, Yemen's primary port on the Red Sea.



 Originally constructed as an oil tanker in 1976, FSO Safer was converted into a floating storage facility in 1987 and has been moored nine kilometers off the Ras Issa peninsula in Yemen since 1988. Unfortunately, the ongoing conflict in Yemen has prevented the ship from receiving maintenance since 2015, leading to its severe deterioration and imminent danger.



 To address this critical situation, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) acquired the NAUTICA from Euronav in March explicitly for the purpose of removing the oil from the decaying tanker. The arrival of the Nautica marks the final phase, as pumping operations have begun. Salvage company SMIT and offshore services provider Boskalis conducted thorough inspections of the vessel before commencing the oil salvage process, and an oil boom has been installed to prepare for any potential oil leaks.



 Once the oil has been successfully removed from the deteriorating tanker, the plan is to tow it to a green salvage yard, the location of which is yet to be determined.",2023-07-20,04:26:04,vlcc-nautica-arrives-in-yemen-to-transfer-oil-from-decaying-,General,[],2023-07-20 04:26:04+00:00,[]
709,459,Stowaways Found Atop the Rudder of the MSC Marta After a Journey of 2700 Nautical Miles,"Two stowaways were discovered on the rudder of the MSC MARTA, an MSC Containership, on July 10th, after it had completed a voyage of over 2,700 nautical miles. These stowaways, two young men, endured a cramped position without the ability to stand upright or find shelter for six days.



 Upon its arrival at Las Palmas de Gran Canaria on July 10th, the vessel, MSC MARTA, docked around 10:00 PM local time. One of Salvamento Maritimo's patrol boats spotted the two stowaways perched on the ship's rudder. Another boat was then dispatched to retrieve them. These stowaways were identified as Nigerian males aged 18 and 22.



 Local authorities took the two men into custody. They had climbed onto the ship's rudder while the vessel was docked in Lagos, Nigeria, on July 2nd. After departing from Lagos, the ship traveled over 100 nautical miles to Lome, Togo, followed by 2,500 nautical miles to the Canary Islands. The two stowaways endured over six days on the rudder while the ship crossed the open ocean.



 Following their discovery, the stowaways were taken to the hospital for examination during their first night. Subsequently, they were returned to the MSC ship. According to Spanish law, the responsibility of repatriating any illegal immigrants lies with the ship's operator if they choose not to seek asylum.



 Although the men had the option to request asylum in Spain, which would prevent their return to Africa, it has been reported that they have family in Italy and may decide to seek asylum there. The MSC MARTA is scheduled to visit Gioia Tauro, Italy, as its next port of call.



 This incident marks the third occurrence in less than a month of African stowaways being found on top of the rudder of ships arriving at the Canary Islands.",2023-07-13,08:08:45,stowaways-found-atop-the-rudder-of-the-msc-marta-after-a-jou,General,[],2023-07-13 08:08:45+00:00,[]

 The man has been identified as Ronnie Lee Peale Jr. He was reported missing in the late afternoon of May 29th after security camera footage revealed that the 35-year-old had leaned from his balcony and fallen into the water around 4:10 a.m. on Monday morning.



 In response to the incident, the US Coast Guard immediately deployed both air and water assets to the search area, located approximately 300 kilometers east of Jacksonville, Florida.

1097,741,CLMVT connectivity and Thai-Chinese high-speed railway,"Thai National Shippers’ Council published White Paper 2022 on CLMVT (Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Vietnam and Thailand) Connectivity Multimodal Transportation in the Next Normal, or “Fast car-boat-rail-link"" transport policy recommendations and guidelines.
White Paper contains data necessary for analysis of transportation costs, and the ways to reduce the costs; challenges and opportunities each form of domestic transport presents. Again, as in previous plans, Thailand is connecting its’ transportation infrastructure development to Chinese One Belt, One Road strategy, hoping to create in Thailand main transportation hub, which will connect SEA countries to China, via road, rail and sea transport. Plans including construction of roads along the Greater Mekong Subregion Economic Corridors; and the construction of high-speed railway linking Thailand to China, via Laos. 

BANGKOK — Thailand’s recent pledge to finish a long-delayed high-speed rail line linking it to China through Laos within six years is reigniting doubts about the country’s commitment and whether the $12 billion megaproject will pay off.
Transport and Foreign Affairs ministries officials told reporters July 6 Thailand will complete the 609-kilometer line from the capital, Bangkok, to the Lao border at Nong Khai, now only 5% built, by 2028. Nong Khai is just across the Mekong River from the Lao capital of Vientiane, where a high-speed train to the Lao-China border started service in December.
With trains running at a maximum speed of 250 km/h, the new line will collapse the time the Bangkok-Nong Khai journey takes now on existing standard-gauge tracks.
The project is part of Beijing’s long-term plans to link China’s Yunnan province to the bustling ports of Singapore via high-speed trains cutting through Laos, Thailand and Malaysia in a key piece of its grand Belt and Road initiative.
Greg Raymond, a lecturer at Australian National University studying China’s growing connections with mainland Southeast Asia, says:
…Thailand is also wary of any moves, the high-speed rail line included, that might draw China too close for comfort.
They don’t want to be drawn in, really, to a Beijing-centered economy if they think it’s going to reduce their freedom of maneuver. They’re always seeking to balance their relationships; they don’t want to become too dependent on any of them. This is the classic hedging behavior, but it’s very strong with Thailand.

The contract governing the Thai-Chinese high-speed railway construction may need to be renegotiated, as construction of the project's first phase between Bangkok and Nakhon Ratchasima is now falling behind schedule, a source at the Transport Ministry said.
The first phase, which is divided into 14 different contracts, is only 15% completed when it should have been 37%, according to the source, citing information reported at a meeting of the Thai-Chinese joint committee on the project's implementation.
The project’s 50.6-billion-baht main contract — known as Contract 2.3, which covers the railway system, rolling stocks, staff training and technology transfer for the 253-kilometre line from Bangkok to Nakhon Ratchasima — has a deadline of March 2026, said the source.
Under the current circumstances, the contract will have to be extended, said the source.

The project’s 1st phase (Bangkok-Nakhon Ratchasima) was supposed to be completed in 2026, while the 2nd phase, a 356km section from Nakhon Ratchasima to the border province of Nong Khai, was initially expected to be completely built three to four years after the 1st phase is completed, said the source.
As for the plan to construct a new Thai-Lao Friendship bridge, China has expressed its willingness to help in every process, he said, adding that the new bridge’s location will not be far from the existing ones.
Earlier last month, Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha and his Lao counterpart, Phankham Viphavanh, had agreed in principle that both nations should build more Friendship bridges to further spur economic growth.
The informal agreement was reportedly reached while the two leaders attended a ceremony held on Oct 28 to lay the foundation stones for the fifth Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge.

1525,1110,Seized Superyacht AXIOMA up for Auction,"The first seized superyacht to be auctioned, the AXIOMA, formerly owned by Russian Oligarch Dmitry Pumpyansky, was seized due to Pumpyansky being added to the US and UK sanctions list. The vessel will be auctioned on August 23rd by the Admiralty court in Gibraltar, where it was seized.



 Pumpyansky’s fortune has come from his stake in Russian pipe-making conglomerate OAO TMK. He was also awarded the Order of merit to the Fatherland in 2014 by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Western sanctions were placed on him due to his proximity to the Russian political leadership.



 The yacht is 72.5m long and valued at $75 million. It was built in 2013 and had a passenger capacity of 12 along with 20 crew members. The interior of the vessel was designed by the veteran designer Alberto Pinto. It has a cruising range of 5000 nautical miles and is powered by twin caterpillar engines, giving it a top speed of 18 knots.



 The vessel was seized on behalf of the private bank, JP Morgan, which was owed a sum of $12.5 million by Pyrene Investments, Pumpyansky’s holding company. The sanction placed on Pumpyansky made it illegal for JP Morgan to accept direct payment from Pumpyansky to settle its debt. Hence the bank asked a court in Gibraltar to seize the yacht and auction it off to repay their debt.",2022-08-01,14:52:11,seized-superyacht-axioma-up-for-auction,Maritime Security,"[{'id': '561', 'attributes': {'assetId': 3429, 'assetName': 'MY AXIOMA', 'assetType': 'vessel'}}]",2022-08-01 14:52:11+00:00,[]

Miraculously, no person or animal was harmed, and no other major ship was damaged by the 399 meters long and 59 meters wide container ship. The MARY MAERSK was unable to come to a stop according to early reports and therefore ended up in the city harbor of Rostock.



 The mega-ship is too long to turn around in the narrow harbor and therefore has to be towed 13 Kilometers backwards out to sea by tugs. A FleetMon spokesperson said, ""We were shocked and fascinated at the same time when we saw the MARY MEARSK right outside our office."" In the meantime, the ship is back again on the open sea.



 However, this visit has left a lasting impression on Rostock's residents.

1983,1523,Tsunami of lawlessness – on Peru oil spill story ,"Italian Aframax tanker MARE DORICUM is kept in detention in Peru, under a threat of $37.5 mil fine if the ship leaves Peruvian waters. MARE DORICUM was unfortunate enough to offload crude oil at Repsol La Pampilla oil terminal, when tsunami, created by Jan 14 Tonga volcano eruption, reached Peru coastline. It’s not even exactly clear what happened, what and where broke off – hose or pipeline or what – but Peruvian authorities were very quick and decisive with accusations and response – Repsol and MARE DORICUM are the culprits. Repsol called to common sense and good judgment, refuting allegations with one good reason – there was no official warning on oncoming tsunami, no order to suspend all cargo operations, nothing was done at all, basically. 
 Peruvian authorities with ever ready global mainstream media enthusiastic assistance, inflated a rather ordinary spill to a full-scale “ecological disaster” event. It is said, that 6,000 barrels (some 250 tons) of oil were spilled, polluting 3 square kilometers of sea and coast. It’s not an ecological disaster, not even close. In several months max (but most probably, weeks), sea and coast will be clean and pristine – Nature will take care of it. But according to authorities and MSM, Peruvian fishermen, tourism and sea life itself, are under threat. I got it, Peruvian coastline is some 5 kilometers long – or how else 3 kilometers of polluted coastline could jeopardize the whole coastline of the whole country (Peru coastline length by the way, is 2,414 kilometers)? What is exact quantity of oil spilled? We don’t know, we have to trust Peruvian authorities with their 6,000 barrels. Somehow, I feel, that less or much less, quantity was spilled. 
 No secret at all why Peruvian authorities instigate and keep inflaming, this “environmental disaster” claim – it’s in trend; and it’s a source of a profit they didn’t count on. 
 Meanwhile, Peruvian waters, specifically Callao waters, have long become the piracy nest, embracing all interested parties – authorities; fishermen and strongmen – robbers. How? Read this – it’s a report, sent to MB by Romanian deck officer in late December last year. Prior to that, several years back, I’ve been receiving complaints from Ukrainian and Russian sailors, arrested and incarcerated in Peru on absolutely false accusations of drug trafficking. There is an unfolding disaster in Peruvian waters, sure, but not “ecological” one. It’s a disaster of lawlessness. Interested may find the “Romanian deck officer report on Callao Anchorage robberies” at MB websites, original and mirror (maritimebulletin.ru mirror site with “Comment” option):

1990,1530,Probe Initiated Into Oil Spill off Peru’s Coast,"The oil spill was near the seaside city of Ventanilla, which is near Lima; the capital of Peru. More than two kilometers of Peru's central coast along with two beaches were tainted by the oil spill. The source of the oil spill is reported to be the oil tanker Mare Doricum, which was rocked by violent waves while unloading crude oil at the La Pampilla refinery. The waves originated from a volcanic eruption and the subsequent tsunami that took place almost 11,000 kilometers away in Tonga. A probe has been launched into the event by Peruvian prosecutors. The fines could reach up to $33 million for the environmental damage if the guilty party was identified.



 There has been significant environmental contamination, causing death of birds and ocean microorganisms. Peru's environmental authority has been forced to cordon off two beaches and a National Natural Reserve. Cleaning efforts are on a war footing. The Environmental Minister has given two days to the La Pampilla refinery to identify critical points and clear the oil within 10 days. Meanwhile, fingers are being pointed all around as to who is responsible for the mishap. The parent company of the refinery; Repsol and the owner of the oil terminal where the cargo was being unloaded; Petrobras have issued no statement. The navy is primarily being criticized for failing to issue a Tsunami warning, endangering the lives of fishermen, and potentially being responsible for the mishap.

1995,1533,European Commission Stops the Acquisition of Daewoo by Hyundai,"The European Commission has stopped the acquisition of Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering Co. Ltd. (DSME) by Hyundai Heavy Industries Holdings (HHH) under the EU merger regulation. The decision was made post the failure of  HHH to formally submit remedies to the concerns raised by the commission in the two years time the investigation was ongoing.



 The intention is to prevent the creation of a behemoth in the Large Liquified Natural Gas carrier market. These two companies combined would have produced an entity that would control more than 60% of the market. The other companies would not have been able to keep the prices of the ships down, if the new merged entity decides to take monopolistic leverages.



 A thorough investigation was launched by the Commission on 17th December 2019 causing the commission to have apprehensions over the completion of this deal. Both the companies enjoy large and appreciating market shares, a combination of the two would have caused a scenario resembling a monopoly. There are huge barriers to entry in the market of manufacturing large liquified natural gas carriers given that these are extremely sophisticated vessels that require a complex building process. There have been no entries into this market recently and there are a few large manufacturers, so if DSME and HHH teamed up customers would have very few alternatives and the other companies would not be able to cover the market demand with competitive prices.



 All these issues coupled with the fact that LNG is an industry that is expected to grow considerably and has not faced any notable impact due to the coronavirus pandemic warranted the decision of prohibiting the acquisition of DSME by HHH.

2003,1539,Train Ferry SASSNITZ: Sad End on the Turkish Beach,"She proudly drove the more than 110-year-old ""royal line"" - now, there is almost nothing left of the SASSNITZ. Her final destination was Aliaga beach in the Aegean. The 172 meters long and 26-meter wide railway ferry arrived on October 20, 2021, at full speed, to be taken between other ships that also have to be decommissioned. A slight smoke signal on the beach served as a final guide for the last crew. The SASSNITZ reached its destination without a load and the highest possible water level. This process is called beaching, making scrapping easier for the shipyard workers. Piece by piece, the steel parts are put on trucks ending in the blast furnaces. Motors, pumps, and other valuable elements such as furniture are offered for sale on the Internet.



 The reliable connection even in times of war



 The first time a train ferry sailed on the ""Königslinie"" was on July 6, 1909. The route was named after Kaiser Wilhelm II and the Swedish King Gustav V. The ""Königslinie"" and its ships were always considered a reliable connection, even during the World Wars and the Cold War. In addition, the distance of about 100 kilometers is the shortest connection between Germany and Sweden. At times, four ships operated here at the same time.



 Decline just before the turn of the millennium



 Since March 1989, the SASSNITZ has sailed the ""Königslinie"". Some of the old crew members were still active on the ship as of April 28, 2020. On this day, the SASSNITZ was the last ship to leave the ""Königslinie"". The GDR Reichsbahn ordered the ferry from Danyard in Aalborg, Denmark, in 1987 for 100 million marks. Even then, shipbuilding was in crisis. Shortly after the launch, the shipyard in Aalborg closed. The SASSNITZ was finally completed in Frederikshavn. Shortly after reunification, the connection was very popular - whether for short trips or just for a little shopping spree. Finally, at the end of the 1990s, the slow decline of the ""royal line"" followed. After several ownership changes, the ferry business ultimately belonged to Stena Line. But the downfall can no longer be stopped. First, Stena Line will sell the TRELLEBORG, followed by the SASSNITZ in 2020.



 Final stop: Turkish scrapper



 The last owner, Stena RoRo, put the ferry up for sale online for over a year. But nobody wants to buy used ferries during the pandemic. So the SASSNITZ finally landed in Turkey. Allegedly, the scrapper Leyal Ship Recycling paid 350,000 euros.

2020,1553,"Postponed Payments, Insolvency Filings: MV Werften in a Big Crisis","Some years ago, people called it the ""job miracle"". Now there is not much left of the glorious future of the three shipyards in East Germany. The shipyards in Wismar, Stralsund, and Rostock initially benefited from the boom in the cruise industry. Their current flagship: The GLOBAL DREAM is supposed to transport 9,500 passengers and 2,500 crew members. With the construction of the cruise giant, the number of jobs in the shipyards was almost doubled. But this dream has turned into a nightmare. Wage payments have been stopped, the shipyards filed for insolvency, thousands of livelihoods are at stake - and whether the ""Global Dream"" will ever be completed is questionable.


 Postponed wage payments and insolvency filings 

 It was a black Friday for the employees of MV Werften. After a staff meeting in Wismar, managing director Carsten Haake stated that the wage payments had to be postponed until next week. However, there is enough money for the salaries of around 2.000 employees. But Haake said they had 30 million euros available. But the legal frameworks would prevent a payout.



 The federal government promised its help. 600 million euros were pledged from the Economic Stabilization Fund to save the shipyards and jobs. Gentling turned the offer down. On Monday, MV Werften and Bremerhaven's Lloyd-Werft filed for insolvency.



 Trading with Genting shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange was stopped at the same time. MV Werft and Lloyd-Werft belong to the Asian conglomerate Genting, which is also in a serious crisis.


Corona finally plunged the cruise industry into crisis

 The corona crisis hit the cruise industry enormously. When the three companies were taken over by the Genting Group five years ago, it was a real stroke of luck: new jobs, tariff payments, and numerous commissioned ships. Then suddenly, in March 2020, the coronavirus struck.



 In the same year, according to Meyer's boss Bernard Meyer, the shipping companies lost 20 million euros. His shipyard in Papenburg only landed one order in 2021. Omikron is currently stopping several cruises.



 However, the industry has been in crisis for decades, declares Ulrich Malchow, ex-professor for maritime economics in Bremen. He sees the decline in 1996 when Bremer Vulkan AG went bankrupt after buying the East German shipyards.



 In addition, shipbuilding has shifted further and further to the Far East since the 1980s. Tankers, container ships, and ferries are produced in countries with low wages. Cruise ships, yachts, and naval ships remain for the German shipbuilder. And the construction of cruise ships will also move to China in the next few years. If Germany wants to remain part of the market, shipbuilders need to develop new concepts. According to Malchow, Germany's only chance is building ships that no one else can create - e.g. emission-free vessels. After all, the federal government has decided that Germany will bring the first zero-emission cruise ship by 2030 on the market.


The future of the MV shipyards is uncertain

 The mood among the 2,000 employees at the shipyards is negative. They are disappointed about the declined agreement. Nevertheless, they hope for the December salaries to be paid and the completion of the GLOBAL DREAM. First of all, MV Werften will appoint an insolvency administrator.



 In addition, Federal Economics Minister Robert Habeck (Grüne) has promised to continue working with the state government of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania to save jobs and the shipyards.

Following a piracy attack on the MSC Lucia container ship in the Gulf of Guinea on 25 October, MSC is pleased to report that the incident has been resolved and all crew members have been found safe and unharmed.
The safety of crew is a top priority and MSC would like to express its sincere gratitude to all participants namely MDAT-GoG, IMB Piracy centres, the Russian and Italian Navies for the remarkable cooperation that led to this successful rescue.



Oct 26 0140 UTC UPDATE: Confirmed Russian Naval Group rescued MSC LUCIA. After receiving alert message from container ship, Russian Navy ships steamed to assist, but long before approaching MSC LUCIA, destroyer VICE-ADMIRAL KULAKOV scrambled a helicopter with team of mariners. MSC LUCIA crew meanwhile, mustered in engine room. Seeing approaching helicopter, pirates left the ship and fled. MSC LUCIA was freed, according to Russian Navy HQ statement, but no other details were provided. As of 0140 UTC Oct 26, MSC LUCIA was under way sailing towards Douala, her port of destination, escorted by Russian Naval Group.



 Oct 25 1600 UTC UPDATE: Confirmed (by Dryad) MSC LUCIA was boarded. MSC LUCIA is still adrift, AIS on. Container ship was approached by Russian Navy supply tanker AKADEMIK PASHIN (IMO 9778193), tanker stopped near container ship. Tanker is escorting Russian Naval Group, consisting of Udaloy-class destroyer VICE-ADMIRAL KULAKOV and salvage tug. So in all probability, Russian Navy is already on the scene, assisting container ship and her crew. Let’s hope this is the case.



 The ship was attacked at around 0900 UTC Oct 25 in Gulf of Guinea, according to ships tracks in the area, container ship MSC LUCIA is most likely the target.

2271,1748,"Adani Ports Decides To Ban Containers From Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran After Record Drug Bust","Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ), the largest port operator in India recently announced that it will no longer deal with any form of containerized cargo from Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. The move comes amid growing concerns of national security after a massive drug seizure at the Mundra Port last month.



 The decision was made public in form of a trade advisory issued on Monday, which read, “with effect from November 15, 2021, APSEZ will not handle EXIM containerized cargo originating from Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan.”



 This was followed by a statement from Adani Ports, part of the Adani Group conglomerate, clarifying that the advisory will apply to all terminals operated by the company including third-party terminals till further notice.



 The statement made no mention of any particular reason behind the decision but speculations count it as a move to suppress criticism over one of the largest drug hauls witnessed by the nation.



 Following the seizure, the Adani Group issued a statement defending themselves citing restrictions on terminal operators to examine containers.



 The seizure on September 14th at Western Port of Mundra included confiscation of heroin worth US$2.65 billion that originated in Afghanistan, which was concealed in two containers arriving from the Bandar Abbas Port in Iran. FleetMon reported on the topic: https://www.fleetmon.com/maritime-news/2021/35361/heroin-worth-280-million-linked-taliban-seized-ind/



 The decision by Adani Ports has raised a flurry of concerns among industry experts including imports worth more than US$260 million being hit after they are diverted from Mundra port, the largest commercial port in India to JNPT at Nhava Sheva in Mumbai.



 The imports of goods likely to be disrupted include chemicals, mineral fuels, and aluminum along with agricultural products like dry fruits and cereals.



 The impact on export costs is also expected to be equally severe with an estimated rise of 20% with the shift from Mundra to JNPT.

Located on Koh Tonsay Island, four kilometers off Kep province’s mainland, the Koh Tonsay Port is the part of Asian Development Bank’s Greater Mekong Subregion Tourism Infrastructure for Inclusive Growth Project phase II.



 The procurement of Koh Tonsay tourism port was organized by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and a local firm “Vimean Chey Group” provided the construction contract for $1.6 million. The procurement of the port was completed on 16 September 2021 and the port construction was discussed on 30 September in a virtual meeting attended by officials from Kep provincial administration, Ministry of Public Works and Transport, Ministry of Economy and Finance, Ministry of Tourism and representatives of ADB and Vimean Chey Group. The Kep province is already renovating the international tourist ports located across the Chhak Kep bay and is about 80 percent complete.



 Deputy Governor of Kep province, Rao Sokha said that the port facility will contribute to the tourism sector on the island and prove to be beneficial for both the local people and the tourists. Sokha added that the port will improve the traveling experience for the tourists as currently upon arrival the tourists are required to jump down at the coastline.



 The port facility would include a 130-meter pier, kiosks for tickets and money exchange, a floating roof platform for docking ferries and cruise ships, information desks, a terminal hall, and a survivor counter and toilets.

2311,1778,India counters Chinese influence on Sri Lanka with new container terminal,"India’s port giant Adani Port has announced that it will be building and operating a new terminal in Port of Colombo, Sri Lanka. The new terminal will be majorly competing with two China-operated ports, the Port of Hambantota and the Colombo International Container Terminal. Amid the growing influence of China in the region, this move can be seen as India’s attempt to counter Chinese influence in Sri Lanka.



 Concerned over the influence of China over its coastal neighbor Sri Lanka, India was working on an agreement with Japan to develop a terminal at Colombo. The efforts collapsed in 2021 due to political considerations and domestic pressure. However, due to its long-term relations with Sri Lanka, India was offered the opportunity to develop the West Terminal at Colombo for which Sri Lanka had issued the official letter of interest in March 2021.



 Indian port giant Adani Ports will be joining John Keells Holding, a Sri Lankan conglomerate for the West Terminal. This deal has made Adani the largest foreign investor in any of Sri Lanka’s ports. The partnership is based upon Build, Own, Transfer agreement where the terminal will be operated by the partnership for 35 years and finally be transferred to Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA).



 In the new company formed out of this partnership, Adani Ports will own 51%, John Keells 34% whereas the remaining will be owned by SLPA. The project will be costing a total of approximately $650 million, which clearly exceeds the Chinese investment of $500 million at the Colombo facilities.



 The new West container Terminal-1 will have a 4500-feet dock and a depth of 65-feet. The construction is expected to begin in 2022. The port will have an annual capacity of 3.2 million TEU once it becomes fully operational.",2021-10-04,08:52:11,india-counters-chinese-influence-on-sri-lanka-with-new-conta,Ports,"[{'id': '1176', 'attributes': {'assetId': 1272, 'assetName': 'COLOMBO', 'assetType': 'port'}}]",2021-10-04 08:52:11+00:00,[]
2339,1803,Statkraft Harvests Power From World's Largest Floating Wind Farm,"Statkraft, the Norway-based, largest supplier of renewable energy in Europe, recently started purchasing power from the world's largest wind farm based in Kincardine, Scotland. The recently concluded 50MW project will provide 200,000 MWh per year to the national grid to provide power to more than 50,000 homes in Scotland.



 Statkraft signed a long-term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Kincardine Offshore Windfarm Ltd (KOWL) in 2018 after the project was granted approval in March 2017. The deal ensures to buy all the output generated at the site at a guaranteed minimum price till 2029 at minimum financial risk to the investors.



 The wind farm developed by COBRA Group is located about 15 kilometers off the southeast coast of Aberdeenshire, Scotland and has a 25-year lifespan. The power was first generated at the site in October 2018 after a 2MW turbine was installed.



 The Kincardine wind farm facility consists of a total of six turbines which include five Vestas 9.525 MW and one 2 MW Vestas wind turbine. The turbines have been installed on semi-submersible floating structures placed at depths ranging between 60 meters to 80 meters.



 The floating platforms have been designed by Principle Power and built by Navantia and Windar Renovables.





 Jaime Altolaguirre, KOWL’s Managing Director from Cobra Group in his statement pronounced Statkraft as a perfect partner owing to its previous large-scale investments in the region.

2362,1821,ExxonMobil Launches Investigation Into Near-miss Accident on Hebron Platform ,"An investigation has been launched into a near-miss incident on the ExxonMobil-owned Hebron Platform off Canada. Even though the incident on 14th September claimed no injuries, it had the potential to cause severe fatalities.



 The Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board (C-NLOPB) in its press briefing about the accident said it occurred when the auxiliary hoist hook along the south intervention deck, weighing approximately 3.6 kg, fell five to six meters to the deck.



 The petroleum regulator also revealed that according to the Dropped Objects Prevention Scheme (DROPS) calculator, the accident had a high potential of causing multiple fatalities.



 The statement added that the incident occurred when preparations for an upcoming lift with no load connected were underway. It also confirmed that the only individual in the proximity of the falling hook was a hoist operator, who managed a narrow escape with no injuries as he stood six meters away.



 ExxonMobil on Thursday revealed that all auxiliary crane operations were suspended since the incident and an investigation had been launched into the root cause of the accident. The probe will be monitored by C-NLOPB.



 The Hebron platform, situated about 350 kilometers offshore Newfoundland and Labrador’s capital St John’s, in the Jeanne d’Arc Basin. The platform has witnessed several accidents earlier, since it began production in November 2017.



 In the most recent accident that occurred on 21st August this year, a worker on board a support vessel, Avalon Sea was injured during a lifeboat winch load testing. The worker sustained an injury on his face after the rigging hit him while it was being unhooked to get rid of a twist. He was then transferred to the Health Sciences Centre through medevac.

The ship was en route to the UAE and was attacked while being anchored in Gabonese waters due to a malfunction in the propulsion system onboard. The pirates managed to abduct the Second Engineer of the ship, Pankaj Kumar.



 The group of 6 reportedly attacked and shot two seafarers as well. They attacked when the ship had to be anchored about two kilometers away from the Gabonese port of Owendo anchorage.



 The vessel was originally headed to UAE from Cameroon but was diverted to Owendo for necessary repairs, with it being the nearest port.



 It has now been 14 days since Kumar was abducted and there has been no information on his whereabouts.  His brother, Sandeep Kumar has written to India's Prime Minister- Narendra Modi, and the Ministry of External Affairs’ offices without success. He has also tried contacting the shipping company Proactive Shipping Management, which has thus far failed to be proactive about the situation.



 He also spoke with John Rupchandani, Honorary Consul of India in Gabon, who reiterated that the search for his brother was carried on by Gabonese officials.



 Speaking to Manorama, the Second Officer of the ship, Deepak Udayaraj, commented on the incident, ""The shootout and all other related events are still unbelievable. Even after two days, I am not able to come out of the trauma.""



 Even though the vessel itself is owned by Prince Marine Transport, the crew has been provided by Proactive Shipping Management.



 His brother maintains that the family is in an extremely dire situation and that nobody has cooperated with them on the matter.

This 24000-kilometer journey from Damen Vlissingen, Netherlands to Australia is the vessel's maiden voyage after delivery.



 The 160-meter Antarctic Supply Research Vessel (ASRV), RSV Nuyina is a replacement for the retired vessel, Aurora Australis. Built under the government's Antarctic strategy and 20-year action plan, the vessel will be operated by Serco for the Australian Antarctic Division.



 The 24,000 metric-ton RSV Nuyina, was officially handed over to Australia in a ceremony on August 19. The journey home began after successful final stage testing in the North Sea. Even though 98% of construction was completed by July 2020, delivery was postponed due to delays in sea and ice trials caused by the pandemic.



 The new advanced vessel, costing AUD 1.9 billion(1.4 billion USD) is set to become the lifeline of Australia's research expeditions in the Southern Ocean and Antarctica. The vessel is also capable of transporting disaster relief, undertaking rescue operations, and conducting patrol duties.



 Research facilities onboard include laboratories, and offices like air chemistry and neurological labs, spread over 500 square meters. It is capable of supporting climate-controlled living for 32 crew, 116 special personnel, and one doctor for at least 90 days.  The range of the vessel is 16000 nautical miles at 12 knots which are accompanied by extraordinary icebreaking capacities of up to 1.65 meters at 3 knots



 RSV Nuniya, designed by Knud E. Hansen, the renowned naval architect, was constructed at the Damen Shipyard Galati in Romania. It was a collaborative effort, by more than 120 Dutch companies, which commenced in May 2017.



 According to Kim Ellis, Australian Antarctic Division Director, the maiden voyage, is a great opportunity to test the capabilities of the vessel over an extended sailing period.



 RSV Nuyina is expected to arrive at Hobart by late October after which it will undergo testing certification over an extensive period of 2 years, to assure secure future operations.

 The rebel state of Northern Cyprus, recognized only by Turkey on Wednesday, revealed that oil slick was just 20 nm away from the coast in the Karpaz Peninsula. The officials also declared that they had deployed a spill-response boom. Turkey has also offered help in mitigation by deploying two spill-response vessels.



 This is the second major oil spill in the Mediterranean this year. It was originally reported by the Syrian government as a small spill of range up to just two to four tonnes. But the independent satellite imagery analysis by Orbital EOS, contradicted the claims, as it revealed that oil slick covered an area of 800 square kilometers by Wednesday.



 The analysis also revealed that the spill was just 7 kilometers from Cypriot Coast and was expected to reach Apostolos Andreas Cape, a Turkish-controlled region in 24 hours, but the prevailing winds have been able to prolong this period. Similar weather conditions are also expected to persist which might drift most of the spill further North.

 Links to connect 2 ports aren’t restricted to highways and railways, understood project implies construction of pipeline, because project suggests oil transportation as well – and in big volumes. 
 The Chumphon-Ranong land bridge project will serve as a link for the transport of oil from the Strait of Hormuz, more than 4,000 kilometers away from the Andaman Sea, to a port in Ranong before it is transported by land to a port in Chumphon, where it will be shipped to other countries in the region, including China, Japan and South Korea, Transport Minister Saksayam Chidchob said.
 
 Oil, indeed, is supposed to constitute the major part of cargo volumes to flow through Land Bridge, so crude oil tankers are to become the main type of ships to call Bridge ports. 
 A number of respective studies have been already carried out, and more are to come, before final plans will be outlined, and final decisions will be made. Thailand is pursuing its’ long-time ambition of becoming an intercontinental shipment and cargo exchange gateway, one of leading ASEAN transportation hubs. A Committee was appointed in July, to facilitate the shaping of the project. 
 
 Land Bridge Project is much less ambitious and therefore, much more realistic, but even this, comparatively moderate project, might be nothing more than a wishful thinking, giving the present situation, both on global and national levels, either economical or political. World economy is on the brink of collapse and it will collapse, or fall into deepest crisis in known mankind history. That is to say, relative to the issue in question, that there are no excessive cargo volumes ahead, which may demand new waterways and new tonnage. On the contrary, cargo volumes are already on the decline, and most likely, will dramatically plummet, in a very near future. There won’t be much demand, if any at all, for Land Bridge transportation option.

2491,1925,"Greek Aframax cleared of spill accusation in Novorossiysk, Black sea ","Seems like Greek Aframax crude oil tanker MINERVA SYMPHONY is cleared of oil spill accusation, and now the main and only suspect is Caspian Pipeline Consortium. It was an oil burst at monobuoy, caused by destruction of hydro compensator, when oil was pumped into MINERVA SYMPHONY tanks via monobuoy. Oil spill covered not 200 sq meters as claimed by Caspian Pipeline Consortium initially, but some 80 sq kilometers, according to satellite photos and estimations conducted by Oceanology Institute of Russian Academy of Science. Scientists say there’s not much to worry about, because spilled oil is a light crude, with very short period of evaporating from sea surface. 



 Initial news: 
 Oil spill occurred on Aug 7 at oil terminal pier operated by Caspian Pipeline Consortium in Yuzhnaya Ozereevka, Novorossiysk, Russia, Black sea. Oil spill covered some 200 sq meters of harbor basin around pier. Spill was fenced off with booms, cleansing followed. In initial news, pipe or loading arm burst was mentioned, it was said also, that at the time of an accident tanker was loading crude, but ship’s name wasn’t revealed. As of Aug 9, there was no definite description of an accident in latest updates, except that the tanker was identified as Greek Suezmax MINERVA SYMPHONY. It is highly likely, that tanker will be blamed for accident, whether tanker was guilty or not.

2538,1960,Aden Port Reports 'Great Difficulty' In Refloating Sunken Tanker,"The Yemen state media agency SABA published a statement by Mohammad Amzarba, CEO of Aden Ports Administration admitting to facing difficulty in refloating the sunken oil tanker 'Dia' despite several efforts since last week when it sunk off the southern coast of the country.



 The oil ship 'Dia' which had been moored and abandoned at Al-Bariqah since 2014, a dumping ground west off the main port, reported having started sinking on Thursday. The sinking has also caused a massive oil spill along with severe environmental damage for almost 20 kilometers along the coast.



 Mohammad Amzarba revealed in his statement that an unsuccessful attempt was made to tug the vessel away from the shore after the authorities were warned of possible sinking a week prior. Even though he blamed the bad weather and strong winds for failing to salvage the ship, but he also acknowledged a lack of specialized equipment that could have prevented the sinking.



 A government convened environment committee reported that the leaking oil had reached a nearby nature reserve causing dead fish to wash up on the shore. Ahmed Fahim, a member of the panel blamed authorities for not undertaking cautionary maintenance of such abandoned vessels, which are a threat to the marine environment.



 But on the other hand, the Yemeni Minister of Fisheries was seen shifting the blame onto the Saudi government. He said that the UAE-backed  Southern Transitional Council which controlled the operations of the port city was deliberately being ignorant to abandoned vessels and causing disruptions to other ports in the region.



 The recent sinking of 'Dia' has also raised concerns about the ship FSO Safer, abandoned since 2015, carrying 1.1 million barrels of crude onboard as a potential threat to the environment.



 According to Mohammad Amzarba, the authorities are willing to make another effort in modest capabilities to refloat the Dia and avoid any further damage.",2021-07-27,12:40:26,aden-port-reports-great-difficulty-in-refloating-sunken-tank,Maritime Security,"[{'id': '1305', 'attributes': {'assetId': 683733, 'assetName': 'SAFER', 'assetType': 'vessel'}}, {'id': '1306', 'attributes': {'assetId': 19504, 'assetName': 'ADEN', 'assetType': 'port'}}]",2021-07-27 12:40:26+00:00,[]

2700,2095,Cosco shipping ports making strides in the Peru terminal project,"Cosco shipping ports has signed an agreement with the Chinese group CHEC SAC – CCCC4TH for the development and construction of a new multipurpose port in Chancay, Peru. The contract was awarded through a tender and the cost of the project is estimated to be about $600 million.  The contract also includes docks, storage space, breakwaters as well as maintenance of operational areas.



 The construction of the first pier is expected to be completed by the first half of 2023. Machinery is being mobilized and the preparations to begin constructions are in the final phase.



 The port is located about 60 kilometers north of the financial and business capital Lima. It is designed to receive general cargo with the exclusion of bulk minerals and containerized goods. The construction of this port will create a direct route from Asia to Peru and the surrounding region. It is expected that the port will have a receiving capacity of 6 million tonnes of general cargo and about 1.5 million TEU’s per year.



 The Ministry has stated that the construction of this port will considerably boost the economy and encourage exports. It will generate business opportunities and employment for over 9000 people, 90% of which will be taken up by local people.



 Another salient feature of the port will be the connecting tunnel that will connect the port entrance and the port’s operational area. This tunnel will be about 1.8 km long and will be exclusively used for cargo traffic thus reducing congestion on public roads.



 The deal for this terminal was signed in May 2019, followed by protests by the local public, stating that the emission of toxic pollutants, noise pollution, large-scale alteration of the coastline, and the destruction of flora and fauna of the area would irreparably damage the local ecosystem. In addition to this, the locals feared the displacement of their homes. The protest was followed by some changes in the plans presented by Cosco and Volcan, and despite the criticism, the project was approved in December 2020. Cosco representatives have claimed that they have the public’s support and that the project is in full compliance with necessary procedures. They further stated that they have obtained permits and licenses and are working in tandem with Peruvian ministries and agencies.

2722,9694,Rotterdam Port calls off tender for unmanned transport,"The tender procedure for the unmanned transportation of containers at the Port of Rotterdam has been suspended. The Port of Rotterdam Authority has said that there were too many risks and uncertainties associated with the unmanned transport on Container Exchange Route (CER) due to which they decided to suspend the tender and inform all the involved parties in the tender procedure.



 The CER enables transportation of containers on the Maasvlakte. A 17-kilometer road network connects all terminals, container depots, distribution centers, and customs facilities on the Maasvlakte.



 The Port of Rotterdam Authority had floated a request on the TenderNed website for the interested parties to submit their tender regarding the unmanned transport on CER. Port authorities did receive technically feasible proposals but due to the complications involved in the project, it was decided to cancel the tender procedure.



 The Port believes that prospects for unmanned transportation of containers from stack to stack will be open in the future. Hence they will keep consulting the experts, potential suppliers, and other stakeholders to explore options of autonomous container transport.



 The CER is under construction and is expected to be operational by the year's end. When CER will be fully operational, 70 vehicles will be needed to shift containers. The port authorities are consulting parties to find ways of using CER with manned container transport. Hybrid autonomous transport is one possible way for the port authorities. In the hybrid format vehicles can be operated by human drivers as well as the vehicle runs autonomously giving the operators freedom of choice.



 For the transportation of containers, port authorities also have to explore options to reduce emissions. European Union has already granted 25 million euros to a consortium headed by the Port of Rotterdam Authority for promoting zero-emission transport in ports. A project having the acronym MAGPIE will be using the EU grant to find smarter and greener modes of transportation in ports.",2021-05-28,06:44:17,rotterdam-port-calls-off-tender-for-unmanned-transport,Ship Building and Technology,"[{'id': '6301', 'attributes': {'assetId': 2036, 'assetName': 'ROTTERDAM', 'assetType': 'port'}}]",2021-05-28 06:44:17+00:00,[]
2723,9695,Volkswagen Set To Add Two LNG-powered Car Carriers to its Fleet,"Volkswagen Group continues to endorse liquefied natural gas as a fuel and has chartered two more LNG-powered vehicle carriers as part of its efforts to decarbonize its operations.



 The company is already using two LNG-powered car carriers hired from Siem on the trans-Atlantic route known as the America Round Tour, which connects Germany's Emden with Mexico.



 When SFL Corporation Ltd released its preliminary financial results for the first quarter in late March, one of the highlights was an agreement to build two 7,000 CEU LNG dual-fuel car carriers in conjunction with 10-year charters to the Volkswagen Group.



 Volkswagen will add two additional LNG-powered car freighters beginning in 2023 as part of a 10-year charter agreement inked with SFL Corporation.



 For the first time across the world, it was the German conglomerate Volkswagen Group who transported automobiles from Europe to North and Central America aboard on a car freighter fueled by liquefied natural gas (LNG). SIEM CONFUCIUS carried over 4,800 vehicles to North America, making it the world's first LNG-powered car transporter of this magnitude.



 To recall, billionaire John Fredriksen's shipping business announced on April 28 that it will charter two newbuild LNG-powered car carriers to a major European vehicle manufacturer without disclosing any additional details.



 Volkswagen has officially been confirmed as the charterer of the 7,000 CEU vehicle carriers that will be constructed in Guangzhou Shipyard International (GSI) based in Nansha, China.



 Volkswagen will charter SFL’s two current car carriers, SFL Composer and SFL Conductor, before the arrival of the newbuilds. The two vessels will be propelled by biofuel, which SFL and the Volkswagen Group emphasize utilizing in their collaboration.



 SFL had stated that the purchase will add more than $200 million to its fixed-rate charter backlog.



 The Volkswagen Group’s LNG drive is significant as it decreases CO2 emissions by up to 25%, nitrogen oxide emissions by up to 30%, soot particles by up to 60%, and sulfur oxide emissions by up to 100%.",2021-05-28,06:39:34,volkswagen-set-to-add-two-lng-powered-car-carriers-to-its-fl,Ship Building and Technology,"[{'id': '61', 'attributes': {'assetId': 691199, 'assetName': 'SFL COMPOSER', 'assetType': 'vessel'}}, {'id': '6828', 'attributes': {'assetId': 462161, 'assetName': 'SFL CONDUCTOR', 'assetType': 'vessel'}}]",2021-05-28 06:39:34+00:00,[]

This investigation was a result of speculated disparities in the consignment details according to the Australian Border Force, as is reported in the statement issued by New South Wales Police, early Monday.



 After seizing the consignment, 316 kg of a crystallized drug with a ""presumptive positive finding"" for methamphetamine (crystal meth), was found. The drug ice was neatly hidden in electric barbecue grills and water heaters. Street value suggests that the confiscated drugs could amount to as high as 100 million dollars.



 Officials of the Border Force have requested help for further investigations from the Organised Crime Squad detectives and also, Federal Police and the NSW Crime Commission under the NSW Authorities.



 In separate news, more than $120 million of narcotics were seized in coordinated drug busts across the middle east and African heartland.



 Nicknamed Operation Lionfish, Interpol led law enforcement officials across 41 countries in the process. It was spread across March and April and brought forth police and customs officials within 2 weeks.



 The drug shipment was received at the port of Lomé, and, along with lorries, got transported across 1,000 kilometers to Libya.



 Brig Gen Adel Abulkasem Al Sharwy Bentaleb, head of Libya’s Interpol National Central Bureau, said, “We are seeing a marked increase in drug traffickers using Libya as a trans-shipment point, including for drugs from as far as South America.

2763,2144,DP World Will Develop DRC’s First Atlantic Deep-Sea Port,"In Banana, located in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), DP World is expected to strengthen its African presence as it begins to develop the port in the DRC heartland.



 Amending previous agreements between Dubai's port conglomerate and the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, DP world has agreed to begin work on the project. Banana, located in Congo Central province, will be hosting the deep seaport by Dubai Ports (DP) World.
 
 DP World, which specializes in port terminal operations, will be receiving a 70% stake of the port, with the remaining 30% going to the DRC government- which is set to serve as the joint venture partner of DP World. The estimated project cost is nearly $1 billion and the investment is to be shared for two years.
 
 With regards to the testimony, the constructional timeframe for the making of Banana Port is foreseen to be two years. This would entice direct calls from large Asian and European vessel lines, resulting in substantial cost and time savings. DRC's West African Coast stretches for 37-km along the Atlantic Ocean. The Banana port will be DRC’s first deep seaport in the Atlantic as well.
 
 Guylain Nyembo Mbwizya (Head of state's chief of staff) and Suhail Al Banna (CEO and MD, DP World's Middle East and Africa region) endorsed a term sheet in Kinshasa. This came in as a review by the parties of the existing contractual document clauses negotiated earlier, when DP World was awarded a 30-year concession to construct and run the Banana Port in March 2018.
 
 
 ""The signing of the term sheet is a key milestone in the partnership between DP World and the Government of the DRC, in moving forward with the project and the firm desire of DP World to be part of the President's vision,"" commented Suhail Al Banna.

 In comparison, JNPT handled only around 4.67 million TEUs in FY21, recording a decline of 7.04 percent over FY20.



 Mundra Port is the flagship port of Adani Port and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ), headed by Indian Industrialist Gautam Adani. The conglomerate is India's largest private port operator.



 For FY21, Mundra handled 144.4 million tonnes (mt) of cargo, reining in a steady growth of 4 percent on a year-on-year basis, as per Hindu Business Line.



 APSEZ has been on an acquisition spree recently, with the port deciding to acquire a 31.5 percent stake in Gangavaram Port Limited (GPL), located near Vishakhapatnam. It's part of the company's 'string of ports' acquisition strategy.

 Instead of a planned LNG import terminal, Uniper has decided to go for hydrogen, with Uniper declaring plans for constructing an import terminal for green ammonia.



 Visit our Blog to read the article ""Green Ammonia - the Key to Decarbonizing Shipping?"" 


Go to Blog

 For producing green hydrogen, the terminal is planned to be equipped with an “ammonia cracker”. It will also be connected to the slated hydrogen network.



 Additionally, a 410-megawatt electrolysis plant is also in the planning stage, which when combined with the terminal, will cater to 10 percent of Germany's energy demands by 2030.



 “Germany and Europe must remain industrial powerhouses: If we want to achieve this and still hit our ambitious climate protection targets, we need hydrogen to power sectors such as steel production, the chemicals industry or in freight, shipping, and air transport, ” said David Bryson, COO of Uniper.



 Besides supplying local industrial powerhouses, possible integration into Germany's national hydrogen network is also planned shortly.



 David added, “We need to get hydrogen out of the laboratory and start using it in large-scale applications and marketable industrial solutions — we should make it into a commodity and exploit its wide variety of uses.""



 Securing Germany's energy supply whilst coping with energy transition into renewable energy has been on the top priority list of German lawmakers and industrialists alike. For this, the ammonia splitting plant, intended to produce green hydrogen, would be the first scaled plant of its kind that adds to the supply line strengthening schemes.



 The COO of Uniper spoke about the challenges and said that importing green ammonia with the sole intent of converting it into green hydrogen serves as an answer to the problem, something that his company has been planning in Wilhelmshaven.



 He said, “Currently, Germany plans to generate 14 TWh of green hydrogen in 2030, but the demand for that year is forecast to be 90–100 TWh — the discrepancy between these two figures is abundantly clear. We will be heavily dependent on imports if we want to use hydrogen to help us achieve our climate goals.""

2933,2285,Norway Stops Rolls-Royce Engine Sales to Russian Conglomerate,"The planned sale of Rolls-Royce's Bergen Engines division to a Russian conglomerate has been stopped by the Norwegian government on grounds of national security.



 Rolls-Royce's Bergen Engines is a firm with over 165 years of history in the shipping industry, 75 alone as a maker of diesel engines. Through a series of acquisitions, the company became part of the Rolls-Royce group. Ulstein purchased Bergen in the 1980s. Later, Vickers acquired Ulstein in 1999, followed by Rolls-Royce acquiring Vickers later that year.



 Rolls-Royce declared in February that Bergen would be sold off to Russian rail and transport conglomerate Transmashholding (TMH) for $180 million. This outcome was a result of a thorough strategic review undertaken by the Rolls-Royce board on the asset disposal process that was first announced in February 2020.



 The deal included divestment of Bergen's medium-speed engine factory and its service workshop and foundry in Norway. The engine and power plant design capability, as well as its service network, was also included thereafter.



 TMH showed interest in Bergen's work, especially in low-emission power, stating that it ""intends to develop a long-term strategy based on carbon-neutral applications.""



 Norwegian Concern:



 The strategic implications that'll follow the sale are what concerns the Norwegian government. Being a member of NATO, Norway's navy and coast guard are dependent upon Bergen Engines' marine powerplants. Naturally, if the company goes into the hands of a Russian conglomerate, the move will raise eyebrows in Norway.



 Norwegian chief of defense General Eirik Kristoffersen told TV2, “If there’s a Russian company owning a Norwegian firm from which we are to receive deliveries, we can’t take such deliveries.”



 However, the Russian Embassy in Oslo did not welcome the news lightly, which told Reuters that the ""anti-Russian implication in this review causes serious concern.""",2021-03-17,07:43:01,norway-stops-rolls-royce-engine-sales-to-russian-conglomerat,General,[],2021-03-17 07:43:01+00:00,[]

2959,2307,The World's First Ship Tunnel Starts to Take Shape in Norway,"Norway has always been a harbinger of innovations when it comes to shipping exclusively. Ever since the time of the Vikings, improvisations in every aspect of traditional seafaring have been challenged by Norwegians, building engineering processes unseen by the world till that point.



 So, when we talk about the world's first tunnel exclusively for ships, Norway deserves to be the one to see another first in the industry.



 Following government approval of startup funds, The Norwegian Coastal Administration (Kystverket) has decided to push forward with an investment of $325 million, completing a 1.7-kilometer tunnel that will be used only by ships.



 The tunnel will be so designed that cargo vessels and most ships in the coastal voyage fleet would be able to pass through the same, marking a modern engineering marvel, to say the least.



 It will allow vessels to circumvent the tricky waters of Stad, a vulnerable area of the ocean along the Norwegian coastline that has gained a notorious reputation over centuries.



 For more than 100 years now, Norwegians have been proposing a tunnel that would help ships in bypassing Stad. The combination of wind, ocean current, and waves makes the stretch of Stad a demanding one for vessels of all sizes.



 Legend has it that the Vikings pulled their ships overland to prevent sailing around Stad in bad weather.



 The team behind the project—known as the Stad Ship Tunnel, states the challenges ships face while navigating around Stad: “Very high waves come from different directions at the same time and create critical situations for vessels. Heavy seas can also linger for several days after the wind has calmed down, which in turn leads to difficult sailing conditions, even on quiet days.”



 Project manager Terje Andreassen explained the next course of action after the project received an initial funding of $8.7 million from the Norwegian government, “We will now start the processes of acquisition of properties in the area where the ship tunnel will be located, as well as put in place a project organization, prepare a tender basis and initiate a tender.”



 The ship tunnel is due to open in 2023.

2997,2340,"Israeli media named oil spill culprit – a Greek Aframax tanker, but no valid evidence yet UPDATE","Aframax crude oil tanker MINERVA HELEN is designated as a prime suspect in recent oil spill accident off Israeli coast, which left dozens of kilometers of beaches polluted with tar. Reports of the pollution emerged on Feb 18, leading to a large-scale hunt for a polluter, with a number of tankers on a suspect list. Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation KAN reported on Feb 22, that MINERVA HELEN is suspected in this spill. 
 According to ship’s records, she transited Suez on Feb 4 and was operating offshore from Feb 4 until Feb 13, off Egyptian northeast coast in international waters, probably engaged in STS operations. She arrived at Suez from Singapore. Tanker spent some time off Alexandria, from Feb 14 until Feb 15, and set sail for Cartagena Spain on Feb 15. As of 1230 UTC Feb 23, she was in Cartagena waters, probably anchored. 
 Manager of tanker, Greek company Minerva Marine, denied any involvement in this accident. Israeli Gov imposed a gag on news revealing suspects names, to “prevent owners from destroying evidence”, but gag was lifted, and some of Israeli news outlets already have no doubts, that the culprit is MINERVA HELEN, which according to them, “suffered a malfunction causing the massive discharge, befouling the waters”. 
 It’s not a proven fact yet, it’s so far, speculations and allegations. Only chemical analysis of samples, and all ship’s operations related records investigations, may present substantial evidence.



MINERVA MARINE Official Statement
24 February 2021
Athens, Greece
Media Statement 
In relation to the unfounded and inaccurate allegation posted in the media that M/T MINERVA HELEN (IMO No 9276561, Greek Flag) is related with the recent oil pollution incident along the coast of Israel, MINERVA MARINE INC, as managers of the vessel, states the following:
From 04 February 2021 until 11 February 2021 the vessel was drifting offshore Port Said, Egypt, awaiting voyage orders in empty condition, without any cargo on board. Drifting while awaiting orders is a routine practice for commercial vessels. 
On 11 February 2021 at about 09:00 local time the vessel moved to the Port Said Anchorage, where she arrived in the afternoon remaining without any cargo on board.
On 13 February 2021 the vessel departed from Port Said and on the 14th of February arrived in Sidi Kerir port, Egypt where she loaded her cargo.
On the 15th of February 2021 the vessel sailed directly to Cartagena, Spain.
During the period that the vessel was drifting offshore Port Said awaiting her next employment, the vessel was not involved in any operation nor in any other activity that could be connected to an oil discharge at sea. 
The vessel is classed with the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS). Minerva Helen is well maintained without any structural or other defects that could cause an oil pollution incident.
It should be noted that on the 22nd of February 2021 the vessel was inspected by the Spanish Port State Control Authorities in Cartagena and was determined to be without any deficiencies or observations, and it was confirmed that the vessel was in a satisfactory maintenance and operational condition and without any defect.",2021-02-23,12:55:33,israeli-media-named-oil-spill-culprit-a-greek-aframax-tanker,Accidents,"[{'id': '1561', 'attributes': {'assetId': 212094, 'assetName': 'MINERVA HELEN', 'assetType': 'vessel'}}]",2021-02-23 12:55:33+00:00,[]
2998,2341,Elbe fairway adjustment completed,"The joint dredging operations by the Federal Shipping and Waterways Administration and HPA for the construction of a passing box have been completed.
 
 The Elbe fairway has been widened to 385 meters along the eight kilometers between Wedel and Blankenese. From today, seagoing ships with a combined width of 104 meters – instead of the former 90 meters – will safely be able to pass each other.
 
 Prof. Dr.-Ing. Hans-Heinrich Witte, President of the Federal Shipping and Waterways Administration, commented: “The widening of the passing box will make the Elbe still more attractive for international shipping. Additional ship width means time gained and easier planning. This will ensure simpler and more effective traffic flow.”
 
 Senator Michael Westhagemann: “With the completion of the passing box, an essential initial stage of fairway adjustment has been achieved. Services by mega-containerships can now be handled distinctly more rapidly and reliably, and this represents a real gain for shipping.”



 The passing box will enable the approach to the Port of Hamburg to be less dependent on tidal ebb and flow. Pending the final completion of fairway adjustment on the Lower and Outer Elbe, some outstanding works connected with the deepening remain to be performed. These include removal of obstacles, profiling, soundings, etc,  and nature conservation measures.

3115,2439,Nord Stream 2 construction work is officially approved to continue,"In German waters, the Nord Stream 2 Baltic Sea gas pipeline's construction can continue after the Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) gave its approval.



 The previous permit allowed the work to continue starting at the end of May 2021 at the earliest. The approval had become necessary because a Swiss company withdrew its special vessels at the end of 2019 following sanctions from the USA. A permit for the winter months had already been issued for these ships. However, after the Swiss companys' exit, Nord Stream 2 had to switch to a different vessel type, including vessels being held or moved by other ships. The permit that has now been given applies to such an anchor-positioned vessel. According to FleetMon.com, a ship of that kind, the Russian Fortuna, left the port of Wismar on Thursday and was on the Baltic Sea off Rostock on Friday morning.







 Last December, after a year-long break in laying work, the ship completed a 2.6-kilometer section of the pipeline in the German EEZ. At the end of December, however, the approval of the BSH expired.



 Starting on Friday, construction works were announced in the Baltic Sea near Bornholm with the participation of floating crane Fortuna. A spokesman of Nord Stream 2 AG told the local newspaper “Handelsblatt” that the company had permission from the Danish Energy Agency to start work on Friday, January 15, 2021. But that does not mean that they will resume the laying of pipes right away. Rather, the technical equipment will be checked first. It is unknown how long this will take.

Pirates might purposefully hunt container ships, for whatever purposes. Cargo is the first thing to come to mind, but pirates can’t load some substantial voluminous loot into their speedboats, unless they don’t have at hand auxiliary boats or ships capable of holding tens or hundreds of tons of cargo. They managed to steal fuel from tankers in big quantities, in recent years.

3181,2497,Chinese Druglord reportedly investing in a Port in Laos​,"Far away in South Asia's Laos, October 6 marked a new beginning for the port sector of the country. The Vientiane Times, a prominent state-run newspaper published news of a 50 million dollar investment to build a port in the Laotian town of Ban Mom. In the second paragraph, readers were told that a man named Zhao Wei participated in a groundbreaking ceremony for the project.



 Well, as per CNN, this Zhao Wei is none but one of the world's most notorious narcotics traffickers. The US Treasury Department accuses Zhao of running a global criminal organization involved in child prostitution, the illicit trade of wildlife including tigers, rhinos, and elephants, and drug trafficking. The entirety of these illicit activities is carried out from Laos, by Zhao himself.



 Kings Romans, the Hong-Kong based company involved primarily in gambling across Macau and other South-Asian countries, owned a 100-square-kilometer swathe of land in the country's northwest, called the Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone (GTSEZ).



 Golden Triangle. South Asia. Yes, the name does ring bells. It is because it's named after the historical lawless border region where Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand meet. Before Afghanistan managed to topple it, the Golden Triangle was the world's largest source of heroin.



 Currently, this region tops the chart for pumping out an estimated tens of billions of dollars worth of synthetic drugs annually, as per the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).



 Both Zhao and Kings Romans were sanctioned by the US government in 2018 for their purported role in the narcotics trade and other alleged crimes.



 As of now, the GTSEZ's main attraction is a grand casino owned by Zhao. But there are plans for massive expansion for the region already in place.



 Zhao's exact role in the new port, which is about 12 miles upriver from the casino, isn't known. But the fact that he attended the groundbreaking ceremony alongside a Laotian deputy prime minister and the provincial government has caught the attention of law enforcement and government officials outside the country.



 Jeremy Douglas, the Southeast Asia representative for the UNODC, worries that any involvement by the alleged drug kingpin could increase the production and export of illicit narcotics from the Golden Triangle.



 That's especially worrying considering that drug smugglers appear to be increasingly using Laos as a synthetic narcotics trafficking corridor.",2020-12-11,14:04:18,chinese-druglord-reportedly-investing-in-a-port-in-laos,Maritime Security,[],2020-12-11 14:04:18+00:00,[]

3197,2511,Piracy Skyrockets in the Gulf of Guinea with 4 attacks in 7 days,"Africa has always been one of the most treacherous waters in the world when it came to piracy. 'Pirates of the Caribbean' may have given the general public an overview of what piracy is, imbibed with humor, but the real-life scenario is quite different. It's life or death here, on the western coast of Africa, currently the world's number one place for piracy and all other shady activities related to the shipping industry.



 West Africa's Gulf of Guinea has been topping the charts for quite some time now when it comes to piracy and crew kidnapping. From a different point of view, one could say that pirates simply lifted their business in and out of East Africa's Somalia, previously known for the same, and settled on the West coast instead.



 Last week, nonetheless, things got a little bit out of hand, even for the pirates. A total of 4 cases has been documented in a sole week, stretching from November 26 to 2nd December.



 In this week, a total of 14 crew members have been hastily captured from their ships, with the time gap between the two incidents being just 3 days.



 The first incident occurred on November 26, when the general cargo ship Milan was attacked and boarded by pirates, who then went to kidnap 10 crew members.



 In a separate incident 3 days later, the Greek tanker Agisilaos was ambushed and boarded by pirates in the Gulf of Guinea south of Lome, Togo, while it was en route from Pointe-Noire, Republic of Congo, to Lome. 4 crew members including Filipino, Romanian and Russian nationalities were kidnapped, with pirates fleeing the spot henceforth.



 And, the list goes on. Armed pirates stormed cargo vessel Tango Rey in Conakry Anchorage waters, Guinea. 6 armed pirates boarded the ship and looted the superstructure and the living quarters of the crew.



 The last attack however shook the pirates quite somewhat. On 2nd December in and around Nigerian waters, the oil tanker Levanto was attacked by a host of pirates. Fortunately, the guards onboard thwarted the attack.



 Kidnappings rose by 40% in the Gulf of Guinea in the first nine months of this year, and the region of West Africa's coast now accounts for 95% of global maritime kidnappings, as per data from the International Maritime Bureau (IMB).



 Pirates armed with guns and knives attack everything from oil platforms to fishing vessels and refrigerated cargo ships.

3305,2601,The mystery of livestock carrier taken to Australian port VIDEO,"Nov 4 UPDATE: There were no mentions anywhere, in official statements or in media, that the ship sent distress or emergency signal/message, asking for help or shelter. She was ordered to interrupt her voyage and sail to Geraldton after flyover and AMSA decision to consider her to be a distressed ship. By the time the ship was ordered to sail to Geraldton, she was outside Australian territorial waters. If Master and owner didn’t consider their ship to be in danger, why couldn’t they have their way? Who’s in command of the ships – Masters, or land-based authorities?



Livestock carrier BARKLY PEARL was ordered to interrupt her voyage and call Geraldton, Mid West Australia, in the evening Nov 2, in unclear circumstances. AMSA and Mid West Port Authority said, according to news outlets, that the ship suffered starboard hull breach and developed heavy list, so much so, that she had to be taken on tow, and towed to Geraldton, arriving there in the afternoon Nov 3 Local Time. The ship was reportedly, heading for Indonesia, with no livestock on board, in ballast. 
 Judging from video, there was no heavy list or any list, except rolling in rough seas. Hole in the hull looks like technical cut, and definitely, not like hull breach, i.e. like a hole inflicted by some kind of accident. 
 Was there any real accident and danger to ship, or was it something else? 
 A damaged livestock carrier has been brought into Geraldton for safe harbour, with all crew reportedly in good health and not displaying any covid-like symptoms. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) ordered the MV Barkly Pearl into Geraldton Port after it sustained a damaged hull about 120 kilometres north of the Mid West town. It had been en route from Fremantle to Indonesia and had no livestock onboard. Vision of the vessel shows it listing with a hole in its starboard hull. AMSA response manager Mark Morrow said there were significant concerns about the vessel and its ability to safely reach Indonesia. ""We held concerns about the integrity of the vessel and the potential for environmental issues,"" Mr Morrow said.""As a result, AMSA issued a direction for the vessel to make its way to safety in the Port of Geraldton.""

3373,2662,Polish divers ready to defuse large WWII bomb,"On Monday, Polish Navy divers began a five-day operation to defuse the largest unexploded World War Two bomb ever found in Poland.



 As a precautionary measure, more than 750 people had to evacuate their homes.



 To anyone knowing the history of World War Two and the weapons used in the same, the Tallboy bomb used by the British was one of the most bizarre, but effective bombs developed. It had been famously dubbed as the 'earthquake' bomb. In use by the British Royal Air Force(RAF) during the last stages of the war, it weighs nearly 5,400 kg, including 2,400 kg of explosive.



 In the Polish port city of Swinoujście (Świnoujście), workers discovered the bomb while deepening the fairway, during construction work in September 2019.







 Copyright Richard Hoare and licensed for reuse under this Creative Commons Licence



 The type of Tallboy found is known as 'dud'. Previously, duds have been recovered from the shipping channel between Swinoujscie and Stettin (Szczecin) several times, but this is the first time that such a heavy object has been dealt with.



 Nobody has ever defused a Tallboy that is so well preserved and underwater, so this would be the world's first such attempt.



 Civilian evacuation from an estimated area of 1.6 miles around the bomb has taken place. The operation will last for an estimated five days, as per the Polish Navy.



 Maritime traffic on the navigation channel and surrounding waterways will be suspended in an area of 16 kilometers around the bomb disposal operation.



 ""The first two or three days will be preparations. Our bomb disposal divers will scrape around the bomb, which is embedded in the bottom of the channel at a depth of 12 meters. Only its nose is sticking out, "" said Grezegorz Lewandowski, spokesman for the Polish Navy's 8th Coastal Defence Flotilla based in Swinoujscie.



 The job is a very delicate one, as even the tiniest of vibration can set off the bomb. A controlled explosion scenario has been ruled out by the Navy, on pretext of a bridge located some 500 metres from the site.



 For this reason, the Navy would use a technique known as deflagration to burn the explosive charge without causing a detonation, using a remotely controlled device to pierce through the shell to begin combustion.



 Tallboys were designed to explode underground next to a target, triggering shock waves that would cause destruction.



 During World War II the area was home to one of the German navy's most important Baltic bases and the area was subjected to massive bombardments. This is the reason why the bomb was found in there.",2020-10-13,07:11:49,polish-divers-ready-to-defuse-large-wwii-bomb,Maritime Security,[],2020-10-13 07:11:49+00:00,[]
3376,2665,​The world's first Zero-Emission Bunker Tankers are on their way,"Japanese owner Asahi Tanker has announced a bold new plan to build the world’s first two zero-emissions electric bunker tankers.



 In August last year, Asahi, along with Exeno Yamamizu, MOL, and Mitsubishi jointly formed the e5 Laboratories. The e5 Laboratories will now design the revolutionary vessel, which has already been dubbed as a giant leap when it comes to reducing carbon footprint in the commercial shipping industry.



 The two tankers will adopt the “e5 tanker” design developed by e5 Labs Inc.



 The very reason why these Japanese conglomerates came to develop the e5 Laboratories last year is to develop electrically powered ships that provide a platform for services that takes advantage of electrically powered vessels and other cutting-edge technologies.



 The said tankers, upon construction, will enter service in Tokyo Bay as bunker vessels after delivery between March 2022 to March 2023.



 Powered by large-capacity lithium-ion batteries, the two tankers will achieve zero emissions of CO2, NOx, SOx, and particulates due to the all-electric core energy system.



 Apart from environmental concerns, noise pollution caused by the ships will get reduced considerably, too. Due to the all-electric system onboard, reduced noise and vibration will create a more comfortable work environment for the crew members. During port stays, port officials can expect limited noise pollution, too!



 Additionally, the vessels will adopt digitalization, automation, and Internet of Things (IoT) technology to reduce crew workload and improve operational efficiency.



 Japanese shipbuilders Koa Sangyo Co and Imura Zosen KK will be in charge of constructing one vessel each, while Kawasaki Heavy Industries will serve as the system integrator for the duo.



 An urgent issue that the coastal shipping sector faces is sustainability and improved workplace for crew members onboard. Asahi Tanker and e5 Lab will jointly engineer the sustainability factor through the development and introduction of these advanced ships.



 Here are some of the specs of the electric tankers:

3377,9801,After 398 days in the Arctic: RV Polarstern reaches Bremerhaven,"Onlookers watch the research ship Polarstern arrive in Bremerhaven



 After 389 days, research vessel Polarstern moored in Bremerhaven, Germany. The ship drifted 3,400 kilometers with a huge ice floe through the Arctic Ocean. Scientists hope to gain new knowledge about the earth's climate system.



 After a year in the Arctic Ocean, the German research icebreaker Polarstern reached its home port of Bremerhaven on Monday morning. During the last nautical miles it was accompanied by a fleet of ships, including the MS Geestemünde and the three-master Atlantis.



 This marked the end of the first part of the spectacular “Mosaic” expedition to research the climate system in the central Arctic: On September 20, 2019, after a ten-year planning phase, the Polarstern set off from Tromsø, Norway, for the largest Arctic expedition of all time.







 Under the direction of the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) in Bremerhaven, hundreds of scientists in changing crews from 20 countries were on board the Polarstern. More than 80 research institutes were involved. The ship drifted 3,400 kilometers with a huge ice floe in a zigzag course through the Arctic Ocean. In the meantime, the researchers collected data in the five areas of atmosphere: sea ice, ocean, ecosystem and biogeochemistry at temperatures as low as minus 42.3 degrees Celsius.







 Seven icebreakers and research ships were used to bring in material and make changes in personnel possible. The Polarstern covered a total of 16,000 kilometers. The budget for this is said to be more than 140 million €. ""Mosaic"" stands for ""Multidisciplinary Drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate"".



 In the Arctic, the Polarstern had drifted for ten months in a zigzag course with an ice floe so that the scientists on board could take measurements in the ocean, ice and atmosphere. At the beginning of the drift the size of the floe was about 2.5 by 3.5 kilometers. Under former melting ponds it was 30 centimeters thin, in its massive core several meters thick. After 300 days the floe in the summery Arctic was only about a kilometer by one - then it broke with a loud bang.



 The researchers hope to gain new insights into the earth's climate system.



 Due to the corona pandemic, the change in personnel was a challenge which threatened the expedition. Entry and exit permits had to be obtained, quarantine regulations had to be observed. Therefore, the crew had to stay on board longer than planned.",2020-10-12,12:01:21,after-398-days-in-the-arctic-rv-polarstern-reaches-bremerhav,General,"[{'id': '1511', 'attributes': {'assetId': 130195, 'assetName': 'POLARSTERN', 'assetType': 'vessel'}}, {'id': '6971', 'attributes': {'assetId': 144037, 'assetName': 'GEESTEMUENDE', 'assetType': 'vessel'}}, {'id': '830', 'attributes': {'assetId': 174, 'assetName': 'BREMERHAVEN', 'assetType': 'port'}}]",2020-10-12 12:01:21+00:00,"['[New FMX, Polarstern in Bremerhaven Port, closeup.jpg](https://media.fleetmon.com/maritimenews/New FMX, Polarstern in Bremerhaven Port, closeup.jpg)']"
3387,9802,Hornsea Two: The world's largest wind farm starts to take shape,"Located approximately 89 km, or 55.3 miles off the Yorkshire coast in the North Sea and adjacent to Hornsea One, the world's largest offshore wind farm is taking shape at an unprecedented pace. The project is designated to be completed by 2022.



 In a recent boost for the project, the first six transition pieces for the offshore wind farm have now arrived at the Buss Terminal of the Dutch town of Eemshaven. The recent development was announced by The Buss Energy Group.



 We analyzed the vessel traffic in the Hornsea area and found out that there was an offshore construction vessel, namely the Innovation that is supporting installation work. Vessel Pacific Orca is contracted to support installation works in 2021.



 In August 2015, project developer Ørsted, which was previously known as  Dong Energy, gained the rights to the project through the acquisition of SMartWind, a joint venture between Mainstream Renewable Power (50%) and Siemens Financial Services (50%).



 Covering an area of 4,735km², the Hornsea Zone has the potential to generate more than 4GW of renewable energy, which would account for 4% of the UK’s overall power generation capacity.



 The zone is situated off the Yorkshire coast, where the normal water depth ranges between 30m and 40m, reaching to a maximum depth of 70m.







 The world’s largest offshore wind farm will comprise 165 Siemens Gamesa 8.0-167 DD turbines. The turbines will operate at a nominal power of 8,000kW, providing electricity to some 2 million British households.



 With a total capacity of 1,386MW, the wind farm is expected to be the largest of its kind worldwide upon its completion.



 Buss Terminal Eemshaven serves as the base port for the project after the company won a tendering procedure from the client Deme Offshore in February.



 Buss provides the staff and storage space required for the project. In addition, it is also responsible for project management for the basic port logistics and the large equipment required. The transition pieces are unloaded from the transport barge using an LR1750 crawler crane. When on the terminal, Buss uses a gantry crane on SPMT axes to move the transition pieces, which weigh almost 350 tons. The monopiles, which weigh up to 1230 tons, are also moved using SPMT axes and transport saddles. The self-propelled transporter has 96 pendulum axles and can hydraulically raise and lower the monopiles. From Eemshaven, the foundation sets are taken to the “Innovation” installation ship - and then to the “Hornsea Two” construction site around 89 kilometers off the Yorkshire Coast.



 However, the Deme Group has faced some sort of trouble in the past. In May 2020, a new heavy-lift floating crane collapsed in Rostock, Germany. This crane was supposed to be used for the installation of offshore wind farms, too. FleetMon had reported on the incident previously.",2020-10-09,07:43:59,hornsea-two-the-worlds-largest-wind-farm-starts-to-take-shap,Offshore,"[{'id': '6973', 'attributes': {'assetId': 153142, 'assetName': 'INNOVATION', 'assetType': 'vessel'}}, {'id': '6972', 'attributes': {'assetId': 125055, 'assetName': 'WIND ORCA', 'assetType': 'vessel'}}]",2020-10-09 07:43:59+00:00,[]
3428,2712,Norway rediscovers a new autonomous green shipping champion,"Renewable energy sources have always been a major deciding factor whenever it comes to Norway and it's policies. The country is a heavy producer of renewable energy because of hydropower and wind power. The country is soon following suit in the ocean as well.



 In a contract signed by Norway's Kongsberg and Massterly (a joint venture by Kongsberg and Wilhemsen) with Norway's leading grocery distributor ASKO, two new vessels will be equipped with autonomous technology. Kongsberg will also look after the company's operations at sea. This is a big boost for the growth of sustainable maritime operations in Norway since funding for the project is being done mostly by local Norwegian MNCs.



 The fully electric ships will replace 2 million kilometres of truck transport, saving 5,000 tonnes of CO2 every year. This solution is cost-effective, sustainable and will remove trucks from a heavily trafficked road.



 The vessels, which are due to be delivered early in 2022, have been designed by Norwegian vessel designer Naval Dynamics and will be constructed at the state-owned Cochin Shipyard in India.



 Currently, ASKO uses almost 800 trucks daily to transport cargo throughout the entire nation. The new RoRos will replace the current solution with a zero-emission transport alternative.



 European proponents of autonomous shipping were stunned ever since the decision was taken in May to put the Yara Birkeland containership project on hold. At that moment, they could do nothing but stare as East Asia took huge strides in realizing the green autonomous shipping dream. This breathes fresh life in the European chapter of the same.

 Japan's Mitsubishi, The Kansai Electric Power Company, Incorporated, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Marubeni Corporation, Mitsubishi Power, Obayashi Corporation and Shell have joined hands to foresee this project.



 Kansai is Japan's spiritual and cultural capital, shaped by towering Osaka and Himeji castles, Zen gardens and arduous journeys to enlightenment. However, modern-day Kansai is also one of the most advanced areas in the world when it comes to green hydrogen utilization projects. A lot of projects involving hydrogen supply and utilization are currently in development in the region.



 Kawasaki's four-phase process (production, transportation, storage, and utilization) in establishing a hydrogen supply chain have seen technological advancements. Concurrently, a vision to realize the commercialization of hydrogen-based energy is gaining momentum at both the domestic and international levels.



 The Council will be involved in laying down the framework for business models on hydrogen utilization in the Kansai region, after studying supply and demand sides to develop a large-scale hydrogen supply chain.

 Though the platform, named Dan Bravo, was unmanned, Total ended up halting output at the plant for the time being.



 Located some 210 kilometres from the western Danish coast, the activists claimed it to protest against oil and gas exploration.



 Denmark is revered as a torchbearer in countering climate change, having one of the most ambitious climate targets the world has ever known.



 The Dan Bravo oil platform produces around 5,500 barrels of oil per day. Total halted the operation citing safety precautions.



 The activists had a message for Danish policymakers: If they don't ban the search for oil and gas in Denmark, the reputation earned by the country in being a green frontrunner would be dented.



 Greenpeace's sailing boat Rainbow Warrior started the action from the port of Esbjerg, Denmark. The vessel ferried the activists in reaching the rig, who then swam 500 metres from the ship owing to safety regulations. They towed their luggage  behind them for occupying the oil platform for an unknown time in waterproof bags while swimming. Due to upcoming storms the Greenpeace activists left Dan Bravo on Aug 20.



 In 2018, Total bought the field from Denmark's Maersk.

 He described the process as a 'race against time' after experts noticed a crack on the ship's hull, which led fears of the ship breaking apart before completion of oil extraction.



 Japan's Nagashiki Shipping, the owner of the grounded bulker, has been actively involved in the oil extraction, providing another ship for the same. Together with a Mauritian helicopter, as well as help from the French Navy, the fuel has been transferred to the shore.

3721,9845,COPENHAGEN's first trip using Flettner rotor,"On 26 May 2020, the Scandlines ferry COPENHAGEN made its first trip using a rotor to travel the route from Rostock to Gedser/ Denmark. What at first glance looks like an oversized chimney of 30 meters height is actually a modern Flettner rotor, which uses wind power to reduce fuel consumption and pollutant emissions.­



 The shipping company uses the rotor on the Rostock-Gedser route to gain experience in CO2 emissions-reducing technologies. According to Scandlines a reduction of four to five percent is possible. The ferry had already been prepared for the assembly of the rotor in a Polish shipyard in late fall 2019. The installation of the 30-meter-high Flettner rotor took place in the Rostock seaport on 25 May 2020.







 



 Developer and manufacturer of the rotor sail is the Finnish company Norsepower. The rotor sail is 30 meters high, five meters in diameter, and weighs around 42 tons. The fully automated solution starts the rotor automatically when the wind is strong enough to achieve emission savings. On the open sea, the cylinder is automatically rotated by electric motors. Propulsion is created by suction and dynamic pressure. The stronger the rotation, the less the marine diesel engines have to work. But the propulsion depends on the right wind direction which is from the side. Therefore, the almost north-south route between Gedser and Rostock and the prevailing northwest wind are ideal conditions for the use of the system.



 The Norsepower rotor is a modern version of the Flettner rotor, which Anton Flettner had patented as a ship propulsion system around 100 years ago. The principle is based on the Magnus effect commonly associated with spinning objects moving through the air or other fluids: the air flows faster on one side of the rotating cylinder than on the other side. Negative and positive pressure creates an additional force that acts at right angles to the wind direction - in case of side winds the ship is moved towards the travel direction. Flettner rotors were already in use in the 1920s.



 In recent years, the rotor technology has experienced a renaissance as an additional drive for ships. For example, the East Frisian wind turbine manufacturer Enercon had the 130-meter cargo ship ESHIP1 equipped with four Flettner rotors in 2010.



 In 2018 a 24-meter high Norsepower rotor was installed on the VIKING GRACE ferry. However, the fuel savings on the Stockholm-Turku line were not as high as hoped.



 The hybrid ferry COPENHAGEN already combines the traditional diesel drive with an environmentally friendly battery drive. The next weeks will show whether the recently assembled Flettner rotor can significantly reduce fuel consumption on the 45-kilometer route.",2020-05-28,13:19:57,copenhagens-first-trip-using-flettner-rotor,General,"[{'id': '4013', 'attributes': {'assetId': 873172, 'assetName': 'COPENHAGEN', 'assetType': 'vessel'}}, {'id': '1720', 'attributes': {'assetId': 5547, 'assetName': 'VIKING GRACE', 'assetType': 'vessel'}}, {'id': '7035', 'attributes': {'assetId': 151866, 'assetName': 'E SHIP 1', 'assetType': 'vessel'}}, {'id': '18', 'attributes': {'assetId': 382, 'assetName': 'ROSTOCK', 'assetType': 'port'}}]",2020-05-28 13:19:57+00:00,[]

4156,3349,"Short-sea routes, Thailand","There’s a number of projects to move road cargo and passengers flows to sea routes in Thailand, and these projects, alas slowly, are carried out. 

Latest project to be launched in Jan next year is ferry line to connect Laem Chabang Port with Bang Saphan Port, Prachuap Province, one of the western provinces of Thailand. It is in the northern part of the Malay Peninsula, some 240 km south of Bangkok.
Existing motorway route is some 400-kilometers long, and it crosses Bangkok bottleneck, adding up extra hours and fuel, required for dragging through heavily overloaded RAMA II road, one of Bangkok’s primary highways. 
Sea route is a straight 250-kilometer long line, connecting Laem Chabang and Bang Saphan, obvious gain in almost every aspect. A number of potential stakeholders already expressed their interest, among them Thailand Sahaviriya Steel Industries PLC or SSI, Southeast Asia’s largest producer of hot rolled steel sheet in coils (HRC), with 4 million tons annual capacity; Big C supermarkets network; a number of agricultural, industrial and retail companies, and tourism business. 
Such demanding ferry line requires a ro-pax ship of substantial dimensions, and operator of the future line, reportedly a private company, claimed they already picked a right vessel for the job of some 20,000 GT. Actually, if put to full throttle to utilize maximum cargo volumes, the line will require more than one vessel.
As a further development, new highway linking Bang Saphan Port with Ranong Port on Andaman sea may if built, become a land bridge across Kra Isthmus, connecting northeast Thailand with its’ southwest provinces and Andaman sea ports, including Yangon Port of Myanmar (via Ranong). 

Another project under consideration is a ferry line Laem Chabang / Sriracha-Songkhla Deep Sea Port. Songkhla, also known as Singgora or Singora, is a city in Songkhla Province of southern Thailand, near the border with Malaysia.
The Cabinet on 7 May 2019 approved the development of Chana district, Songkhla Province, as the fourth model city in the deep South, yo be developed into an industrial model city for the future, aimed at generating employment and income for local people, as well as promoting local production, sea freight, and tourism. Major industries include ago-industry for seafood processing and the production of rubber and oil palm.
Project, to be carried out by the private sector, in accordance with 5-year plan from 2019 to 2023, includes the development of the second Songkhla deep sea port, the investment in the construction of an Energy Complex, the establishment of the Chana Industrial Estate, water and environmental management, and the setting up of a fund for the development of the quality of life of the people.
All relevant governmental bodies are working together in setting various incentives to encourage the private sector to invest in the Chana model city. 
Private investors already indicated their interest in this ferry line, but there are no specifics yet, and no definite timeline. 

One more potentially viable ro-pax ferry link can connect Laem Chabang /Sattahip ports with Surat Thani Port, Surat Thani province, southern Thailand, but the problem lies with Surat Thani entry channel depths, which as of now, aren’t sufficient to provide navigation of big vessels. There are no known potential private investors yet, interested in this project, because, understandably, there are no definite projects on port and canal reconstruction.

Short-sea routes can and should have significantly bigger share of Thailand inner transportation, so there’s quite a potential for short-sea routes growth. Bangkok is the biggest motorways hub in the country, the city is plagued by heavy traffic, substantial part of it being transiting trucks and cars, connecting southern provinces with main Thailand sea ports, scattered along northeast coast of Gulf of Siam. 
There’s a perceptible, visible disproportion between short-sea, and motorways cargo flows. Nation’s every main motorway crosses Bangkok, starts in Bangkok or ends in Bangkok, adding up to its’ traffic woes, and negatively impacting transportation costs and effectiveness. With growing industrial production, trade and tourism volumes, land transportation as the main and indeed, the only option, has become a negative factor, hampering nation’s economy growth. Geographically, it’s inevitable, because North and South are connected by a narrow isthmus bridge with Bangkok on top of it, thus physically constraining land cargo flows. It is straining main motorways, running along coastline, Bangkok and coastal communities roads, to the limits of their traffic capacity, not to mention environmental concerns. 
Short-sea routes development seem to be much better option, than endless motorways renovations and construction of ever new by-passes. Short-sea routes development is slowly gathering way, though there’s growing risk, that spinning “environment” restrictions and extra costs, imposed on shipping globally and locally, may render short-sea shipping non-viable or plainly impossible.
There’s one more concern, one more predicament to slow down or suspend short-sea projects. There’s a growing feeling of economy being overstretched, not just Thailand economy, but globally, including Thailand. Governments and other bodies spendings are spiraling out of control, like there’s not much time left until the end of the world, and all they care about is not to be late with bankruptcy in this insane race.

4359,3534,Meet Bangsaen Grand Prix street circuit car races Photo Video ,"Bangsaen Grand Prix 2019 car race week is over, more than 200 hundred race cars roared out during Aug 27 – Sep 1 street circuit event. Once Thailand-only race got an international status since 2017, and now is listed as FIA Grade 3 circuit, hosting Porsche Carrera Asi Cup and TCR Asia Series, plus traditional “Thailand Super Series” races, which include Thailand Super Car GTM Plus, Thailand Super Car GTM, Thailand Super Car GTC, TCR Thailand, Thailand Super 2000, Thailand Touring Car, Thailand Super Pickup, Thailand Super Compact, Thailand Super Production, Thailand Super Eco , Cayman GT4 Trophy Thailand, and TA2 Thailand.
   Three Formula 3 cars did a demo run during the 2019 event, and probably (and hopefully), Bangsaen will soon add Formula 3 to its’ Grand Prix calendar. 
 
   The race was first organised in 2007 by the Three Crowns organisation, headed by local politician and Porsche racer Sonthaya Khunpluem. From relatively small beginnings with a handful of races for local categories and some quite exotic types like Cooper and Retro, annual Bangsaen Speed Festival slowly, but surely, was gathering momentum, until the breakthrough in year 2014, when TSS President Sontaya Kunplome tasked the Bangsaen event organisers with turning the Speed Festival into a world-class event, able to attract foreign drivers and teams as well as hosting increasingly powerful machinery, including TCR touring cars and GT3 sports cars. At the core of the strategy was the achievement of FIA Grade 3 certification.
   Well-known in car race community entrepreneur Simon Gardini, whose previous work on the Kuala Lumpur and Singapore street circuits as well as numerous Australian events gave him excellent credentials, advised the organising committee on how to upgrade Bangsaen to meet the stringent criteria.
   Finally, in year 2017, Bagnsaen race circuit was certified by FIA, and has become firm fixture on the Thailand Super Series, Porsche Carrera Cup Asia and  TCR Asia calendars.






   What’s Bangsaen in the first place, where is it situated, and why do I report its’ street races events? Bangsaen is a small coastal town in Chonbury Province, Gulf of Siam, some 150 kilometers from Bangkok. It’s a very popular among Thais, especially Bangkokians, resort, it also hosts Burapa Universtity, so about half of town is occupied by University and campus, while another half is busy with profiting from holiday-makers. 
   I moved to Bangsaen several years ago, lured by fantastic views from a balcony of the apartment I rent, by drowsy quietness of the place in general, and proximity to Laem Chabang Port and Koh Sichang Anchorage. I didn’t know about races, until incoming annual event locked me, unaware and unprepared, in my condo, for some 5 days. My condo is bordering the circuit, and during the event, condo is literally, cut off, with no way in and no way out from 0730 am until 0600 pm, except one 10-15 min window. 
   I’m not car addict, didn’t and don’t have one, I can’t even drive the damn thing. I drive a motorbike, and I’m quite happy with it. Nor did I was car races fan, but after watching that first race raging right under my nose, I turned into car races fan. 
 
   From what I gather, mostly from personal experience, street circuit race is quite different from regular circuit races. You’re, kind of, part of it, especially if you happen to live in the house, enveloped in the circuit. The roar is so loud you have to yell to be heard even when in the apartment, the air around, the smell is pure adrenaline – it’s not your pathetic city traffic jam stench, it’s a noble smell of highest quality petrol, burning oil and tyres. 
   There’s one feature in street circle races, which makes them delightfully different from permanent circuits. One can approach the track in many spots as close as guts permit, to take pics or video. Bangsaen circuit is spectacularly picturesque, running through town streets, hill road, and along sea coast. Onlookers aren’t chained to seats and stands, they can move around, with fantastic spots for filming and taking pics, scattered along the track. And it’s all free, of course, there are no tickets or charges in any form.







 
   I’m not an avid fan, mind you. No favourite teams or drivers or types of cars, nothing of the kind. I love it all – the sensations, dramatic developments and outcomes of races, cheering for unexpected leader or for favourite after his sudden crash, so on and so forth. 
 
   Walking and talking around, one may hear and watch a lot of interesting stuff. Say, a story about a rising star in Australian car races, a tall blonde youth 18-years old or younger. He was very good at Bangsaen, also. I noticed, by the way, quite a number of young drivers from Europe and AU, distinctive for their aggressive manner of driving. Each race with their participation was something of a suspense, a thriller. They’ve been driving on the verge, so much so, that quite often rivals gave them the way, being pressed both psychologically and physically – young hotheads recklessly overtaking them in sharp turns, or bumping them from behind.
 
   There was silver-black Mercedes racing car, radiating glamour and wealth, participating in Thailand Super Series Race. It was interesting to learn, that the car belongs to Malaysian Princess. Car team, sent to Bangsaen, included everything, from technicians to lawyers and security, ready for any kind of accident or predicament. To be on the safe side, two drivers were strictly prohibited booze and courting local girls. Is silver-black Mercedes worth such sacrifice, I wonder? 
 
   A car belonging to dirty rich New Zealander crashed in Qualify, being indisputable leader. “No problem” – I was told by an insider. The team has everything they need to fix a car, providing there’s anything left, be it just one wheel. All they need is one night. And the car rolled out next day, all shine and fighting spirit.
 
   If you look through photos of female drivers, you may easily mistake Grand Prix for a beauty contest. There’s a surprisingly big number of girls riding race beasts, including such “masculine” ones, as pickups or TA2.



















 
   Bangsaen circuit does have its’ problems, of course. One’s track cover, having much to improve, and another one is quite exotic, found by many visitors as funny and amusing. It’s monkeys. Part of the circuit runs through foothill of densely forested Kao Sammuk Mountain, inhibited by monkeys. It’s a closed habitat, with feeding capacities, restricted by acreage. Tourists feed monkeys also, mostly on weekends, and all of it was more or less self-regulated and sustainable, number of animals not exceeding feeding capacities of the area. That is, until do-gooders decided to allocate funds for monkey food and food-stands. Monkey population sky-rocketed, with predictable outcome. Natural feeding grounds can’t support so many animals, tourists also can’t provide food enough to feed extra population, and naturally, monkeys started to move on to other territories, in search for food. There are no other territories around except houses circling mountain, and further on, town. Monkeys are becoming increasingly, and dangerously, aggressive. This 2019 event was the first since the beginning of Bangsaen races, when monkeys regularly ran onto track, sometimes in big numbers. Now, imagine powerful TA or Porsche race car, raging at some 200-250 km/h speed, and hitting monkey. It’s very dangerous for a driver and for other drivers behind him. Authorities did come to their senses several months ago, canceling “feeding” fund and closing down food-stands, but it will take quite some time, before monkey population reduces to sustainable size. It’s Thailand, where monkeys – all animals, for that matter – are sacred, and can’t be killed, so there’s no other choice except waiting until Nature takes its course.






   Bagnsaen is conveniently situated halfway between Bangkok and seamen top favorite Pattaya, close to Laem Chabang and Koh Si Chang Roads, about an hour taxi drive from Suvarnabhum, main Thailand airport. Number of foreigners visiting Gran Prix event is steadily growing, especially after Grand Prix status raised to annual international race event. I’d like to invite all crews on ships, which happen to be docked at Laem Chabang and Koh Si Changs Roads during Grand Prix event, to think twice before going to Pattaya or Bangkok, and turn to Bangsaen instead. Street circle races are quite unique, and absolutely free to watch. Bangsaen is about as close to Laem Chabang, as Pattaya, and much closer if your ship is anchored at Koh Si Chang Anchorage and you’re landing at Sri Racha. If you can ride a scooter or motorbike, rent one, to save time and money. Arm yourself with camera and smartphone, and enter amazing world of Bangsaen street circle races. Next event will be held in 2020, just search Bangsaen Grand Prix 2020 to find out month and dates.

4550,3707,"Ocean Marina Yacht Club, Sattahip, Gulf of Siam ","If Thailand can’t boast of having sea ports rivaling such South East Asia giants, as Singapore or Hong Kong, it may nevertheless, deservedly boast of having the biggest in South East Asia yachts port – Ocean Marina Yahct Club (OMYC) in Sattahip, Pattaya, Gulf of Siam. 
 https://oceanmarinayachtclub.com/ 
 Established in 1989,  Ocean Marina Yahct Club developed into Thailand’s and SEA region premier marina resort complex, capable of hosting yachts of all types, up to 50-meter super yachts, along Marina’s top quality floating berths. 
 7 years ago all floating berths were replaced with new ones, manufactured in France. The whole Marina berths area was retrofitted after Australian standards. Marina is capable of berthing 330 boats, of 10-50 meter length. 
 All kinds of services are available, from electricity and water supply to dry docking and storage, to year-round maintenance and repairs. 
 Marina is guarded by triple security system, including access cards, CCTVs, security guards. 
 Golf carts to move ship-shore. 
 All existing types of sailing training and courses are available:
 https://www.sailingschoolthailand.com/sailing-courses/ 
 
 Sailing yachts are my life-long passion. In my teen years I’ve been racing on famous Finn class boat, and as a marine cadet, I took part in cruise yachts voyages in Russian Far East and NSR seas http://www.boatportal.ru/articles/653. Those were 12-meter long Bermuda sloops, with no engine, no electricity, no GPS, and no toilet, either. We’ve had sextant and magnetic compass for navigation, gas stove for cooking, and railings to hang on as toilet.  
 I cherish a dream of my own home, not much hope, though, considering my very modest income and my age, but who knows. Miracles happen. Anyway, the point is, I am not sure I want an apartment or house, a real estate, anywhere, in Thailand or Russia or any place else. Too many uncertainties, plus total mistrust towards all and any States, their laws and their authorities. Sailing yacht seems like an ideal alternative. 
 Of course if I manage to buy a yacht, it will be something modest, some family cruiser type, 14-15 meter long max. Hopefully, if my dream comes true, it wouldn’t be too late, and planet wouldn’t be transformed into Green, Sustainable, UN-flagged, Worldwide GULAG. Because there’s no place in that New Green UN Agenda 30 project for anything personal, anything not under control, any individual freedom, including a freedom of moving around on independent, personal vehicle.
 With that dream in mind, though not much else in material means, I regularly entertain myself by building up plans and scrutinizing options. 
 
 My future cruiser yacht is to be my home and my office. I can’t take long voyages, crossing seas and oceans, because my job just doesn’t allow long trips without constant reliable internet connection. I’ll have, most of the time, to stay berthed. I will need some 5 meters pier length, to make fast stern, I don’t need alongside berthing. 1 meter pier rent is 1,200 Baht monthly (non-Member), it’s some 5,000 – 6,000 Baht total ($150-180). Studio or 1-room apartment rent is anywhere between 8-9 and 20-25 thousand Baht, monthly, depending on location area, sq. meters, condominium condition and facilities, etc. 
 Electricity, water and sewage removal bills will hardly exceed electricity bill in condo, where air-con is the main expenditure item. 
 
 Being based at Marina, I’ll have an access to all Marina facilities, including some vitally important for me, such as Fitness Center and a parking lot. If I am to become a constant resident at Marina, on board of my boat, Ocean Marina Yacht Club Membership looks like a feasible option, granting me privileges at all facilities and services of the marina, and yacht club, with a special member rate such as berthing fee, repair services, yacht charter, etc. Individual Membership Annual Type cost is 65,000 Baht (around $2,000). It will pay off, with all the discounts and special rates it envisages. For example, Member Wet Slip berthing rates are half of those for Non-Members. Same goes with most of other rates and charges. Another example – I have to workout every day, 365, no days off. It’s not the question of looks, it’s a question of health. Either I do my fitness, or I feel lousy, I become physically ill. And I have to sweat out real hard, some 40 minutes at least. Fitness and smoking (the best food consumption regulator there is) are my main medicine. Fitness Center with Olympic-style swimming pool don’t come cheap, Membership discount therefore, will be quite a relief. 
 
 Lack of your own vehicle, be it car or motorbike, is a serious inconvenience. Staying at Marina, you will inevitably, need some regular shopping, food, clothes, etc. Being in Marina, you’re 6 kilometers from Pattaya City, full of world-class shopping malls, boutiques and restaurants serving Thai and international cuisines. Well, without your own transportation means, you’ll find Pattaya shopping trips quite an ordeal. The best choice, though most dangerous, is a motorbike. Again, Membership parking lot comes cheaper than Non-Member one. 
 
 Boat can be cleared for a yearly, 6+6 months basis, stay in Thailand waters. It’s a maze of documents and requirements, so you’d better contact and consult companies which, for a fee, will manage clearing process. Here’s one: https://www.buzzcats.com/import_and_export.shtml
 Boat skipper and crew don’t have any privileges or status as yachtsmen on board of their own boat, and are subject to general visa requirements. The best option of course, is a one-year visa, either working, or retirement, or student. If non of the above, you’ll have to get 3-month tourist visa in Thai Consulate, or get a 1-month visa on arrival. Overall, long-time stay in Thailand is a problem, if you can’t get 1-year visa. Visa regulations and enforcement are becoming more strict, with each passing year. 
 
 Gulf of Siam waters provide a variety of casual trips around, including trips to famous islands and beaches of Samui (some 200 nm SW of  OMYC) or Trat Province islands, including such well-known resorts as Koh Kud or Koh Mak (some 140 nm SE of OMYC). OMYC is holding Weekend racing IRC, Multihull & Cruising classes, second week each month, plus a number of international regattas, see 2019 Calendar:
 https://oceanmarinayachtclub.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2019-Sailing-Calendar.pdf 
 Thailand is hosting world-class Marinas on Phuket island, Andaman sea, so it’s one’s choice where to stop and stay. Phuket waters give access to Andaman sea, Indian ocean, and Europe. Gulf of Siam is linking Thailand to South East, Northern Asia, Americas and Australasia, Gulf is in fact, the Pacific outskirts. 
 Back in 2010, one Moscow Bank asked me to find luxury yacht, stolen by Bank’s debtor in Europe, and presumably, taken to Thailand. That debtor by the way, was and still is in Wanted list not only in Russia, but in a number of other countries, for multi million frauds. I combed all Thailand Marinas, and found the yacht on Phuket, on the verge of giving up, while checking the last Marina on my list. I stayed on Phuket for some 2 months monitoring yacht, until Bank proved yacht’s ownership. The point is, I didn’t like Phuket. It’s kind of, different. If you stay for a long time, and got accustomed to eastern Thailand along its’ Gulf coast, you may feel some discomfort when visiting Phuket. 
 
 If one’s cruising around South East Asia – Pacific region, and looking for Marina as a base for prolonged and regular stays, repairs and maintenance, Ocean Marina Yahct Club, Sattahip, seems to be an excellent choice.

On Feb 27 this year, a small fishing boat with 6 fishermen while fishing in the vicinity of the island, was caught in storm, and started to sink. 4 fishermen decided to swim ashore, 2 were too afraid, and remained in the boat, never to be heard of again. 4 people safely reached the shore of the island, knowing all too well its’ reputation. They stayed on island for 3 days, and survived. How? 
All the time they have been on island, they remained on the beach, and didn’t enter, even for the moment, forest which surrounded the beach. They’ve been drinking rain water and eating bananas they cautiously picked up on forest fringes. After 3 days of the horrific ordeal, they spotted a boat approaching island, and rushed to sea to swim for it. Boat with 8 tourists and diving instructor picked them up on Mar 3, and delivered to Emergency Care Unit. 
Just imagine what it was like, to survive on the border, on the very edge of a hell, in the open, being so near to shelter (forest, caves, lighthouse), yet unable to reach it, because there is no chance to walk around, and stay alive.",2019-03-12,16:54:36,how-to-survive-unsurvivable-4-fishermen-stranded-on-deadly-s,General,[],2019-03-12 16:54:36+00:00,[]

4907,4015,Cruise ship aground in Sulu sea – sheer madness ,"Cruise ship FOREVER LUCKY ran aground on Jan 7 in Sulu sea 15 nautical miles northeast of Cagayancillo, Cagayancillo island, Palawan province, Philippines, while en route from Bataan to General Santos for repairs. 15 crew were evacuated. As of Jan 12, the ship was still aground, monitored for possible oil leak. Filipino salvage company was said to be contracted for salvage.
In July last year, MV Forever Lucky was stopped by port authorities in Orion, Bataan from leaving for Micronesia for allegedly smuggling 139 Filipinos to illegally work overseas.

Comment: It looks crazy and sounds crazy – Russian inner waters are still full of cruise ships of this type, but these ships are strictly and only inland waters ships, they are not seaworthy, though sometimes irresponsible owners and authorities allow them to take short sea coastal trips, in Black/Azov seas mostly. Fresh sea and wind will sink such ship in no time. It is absolutely irresponsible for Filipino authorities to allow such ship to navigate Filipino waters. Thankfully, the ship went into trouble without passengers on board.

Inland cruise ships Projects 302M/302K – 27 ships series built in East Germany during 1983-1991, length 130 meters, depth moulded 4.5 meters, dwt 3850, 3 engines, speed 25kilometers/hour, capacity 300 passengers, crew 100. 
3 such ships built in early 90th were sold to China and transported in floating dock, all 3 were exploited as cruise ships, later as casions and hotels, probably one of them was sold to Philippines.

   Oct 30: Two cargo ships were attacked by pirates west of Pointe Noire Congo, West Africa, at around 1300 UTC Oct 29. One managed to escape, another one was hijacked. It’s tanker ANUKET AMBER, according to information I received from crew relatives, who’re understandably, very worried. They’ve been told by crewing company, that connection with ship was lost, manager and other involved parties are taking all necessary measures. They weren’t told if the ship was hijacked or troubled by other accident. No news, no AIS signal since then, so presumably, tanker was hijacked with the purpose of stealing its' cargo. If pirates were in for crew and ransom, they’d already leave tanker with kidnapped crew, and tanker should already re-emerge.

Pirates of Gulf of Guinea kidnap crews for ransom and keep them on land, but they didn’t ever hijack the ships and hold them in a way Somalia pirates did, because they don’t have safe dens to keep hijacked ships for weeks and months, required for getting a ransom.

5677,4668,Swiss tanker seized by Nigerian Navy in strange circumstances ,"The Nigerian Navy said in a statement issued on Mar 9, that they arrested product tanker SAN PADRE PIO with 16 all-Ukrainian crew and some 5000 tons of oul product on board for unauthorized entry into Nigeria waters, and illegal fuel trading. The ship was seized on Jan 23 and is presently anchored on Bonny anchorage, why did it take Nigerian Navy so long, to make an announcement, is unclear. 
The Captain of tanker, Mr. Andriy Vaskov, claimed that the vessel had clearance from the Nigerian Navy to ship the product to Nigeria. Vaskov named Blue Sea Marine Company as its Nigerian partners.
He said that they lifted the product from Lome in Togo and attempted to discharge the product at Odudu oil fields to its Nigerian partners before their arrest. ““This is about the fifth time that we have transported petroleum product to the country,” he confessed” – well, he claimed his innocence, but nevertheless, “he confessed”. 
As everything related to Nigerian waters and maritime safety and security, these news are curious and not exactly trustworthy, to say the least. What really happened in there, why tanker was seized after transporting fuel shipments to Nigeria for some time, is a mystery. The main mystery is, why foreign shipowners, risking their crews, still do any business in Nigeria at all?

5728,4714,Thailand Merchant Marine can play a bigger role,"Notwithstanding Thailand geographic location, which puts nation outside main global cargo flows, Thai’s merchant marine fleet is listed in top 35 nations, albeit second-to-last, with Oman closing the list. As of 2017, total number of Thailand-owned ships was 393 (7,022,484 tons of dwt), with comparatively small percentage of ships registered under foreign flags, 27.84 percent against world average of 70%. 
Thailand Flag is among Top 35 Registries, with 781 vessels (including fishing vessels) registered under Thailand Flag of  5,374,875 dwt tonnage. 

As of year 2010, Thai Merchant Marine Fleet of 363 ships included ships by type: 
bulk carrier 31, 
general cargo 99, 
chemical tanker 28, 
container 18, 
liquefied gas 36, 
passenger 1, 
passenger/cargo 10, 
petroleum tanker 114, 
refrigerated cargo 24, 
roll on/roll off 1, 
vehicle carrier 1.

Thailand Shipowners Association embraces some 50 members, with combined fleet totaling 347ships of 2,919,024 dwt. 
Among them world-known companies such as Precious Shipping with the fleet of 36 modern bulk carriers, ranging from Handy to Ultramax, and Thorensen Shipping, owning 15 modern Handymax bulk carriers. 
Sang Thai Navigation 1977 owns modern fleet 8 of general cargo ships of average 10,000 dwt. 
Regional Container Lines Company runs a bunch of well-known BHUM container ships of up to 32,000 dwt. 
Prima Marine Company owns two VLCC (one converted into FSU). 
Nathalin Company bags one VLCC of 310,000 dwt. 

Bangkok and Laem Chabang are the main Thailand ports, according to latest Annual Report 2014 of Thailand Ports Authority, Bangkok turnover was 21,422 million tons and 1,519 million TEU, Laem Chabang handled 72,264 million tons and  6,459 million TEU. 
In 2016 Laem Chabang had 6,312 vessel calls, up 0.11 percent over 2015, while Bangkok Port had 3,067 calls, down 5.5 percent from 2015.

As probably, everywhere around the world, Thai shipping industry blames, partially at least, government, for underestimating Merchant Marine importance for national economy. It’s a common story – governments are happy to profit from shipwoners, but very unhappy when it comes to supporting them, even if some specific support doesn’t bear any expenses. 
Still, the main factor hampering Thai Merchant Marine development seems to be determined by Thailand geographic location, putting the country outside main cargo flows and seaways, albeit very near. That’s why Thailand is trying to re-direct some cargo flows to its’ ports.

Most ambitious plan of Thailand with regards to expanding its’ ports facilities and role in regional shipping is the plan to transform the deep-sea port in Laem Chabang into the “Rotterdam Port” of Asean.
“Laem Chabang Phase 3 will be an important project as it will be developed to become ‘the Rotterdam of Asean’ to help distribute goods from China, Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar to the rest of the world,” said Vice PM’s Office Minister Kobsak Pootrakool in July 2016. 
“Ranked as the world’s 21st busiest container port by total container volume (as of July 2014), Laem Chabang Port is continuing to raise its capacity and competitiveness, to meet the anticipated surge in cargo volume arising from Asean Economic Community (AEC) integration and to enable Thailand to compete effectively under the tougher market conditions of the AEC”, said officials.

But of course, major project which will undoubtedly, boost Thailand Merchant Marine and shipping in general, is Kra Canal project 
It was believed after official statements late last year, that the project is shelved, at least for the time being. But here it comes again:

The Thai Canal Association for Study and Development has filed a formal request to the current government to undertake a full feasibility study to make the Kra Canal a reality.
The news was broken at the British Chamber of Commerce in Thailand (BCCT) Phuket Business Dinner event at the Amari Phuket resort south of Patong on Thursday night (Feb 1), where two key proponents behind the project – Royal Thai Navy Adm (Rtd) Soopakorn Boonranadiloak and Pakdee Tanapura – were guest speakers.

Key to the surge in approval is likely the new planned route polled. The new route, dubbed “9A”, is located further up the coast than its predecessor, “5A”, which would have seen ships enter the canal at Pak Bara in Satun. Only 135 kilometres long, the route 9A will see ships enter the canal at Sikao in Trang, little over 100km in a direct line southeast of Phuket.
The reasons behind this new request are rather controversial and superficial, but after all, the supporters of the idea are asking for a feasibility study, not the immediate implementation. 

Thai Merchant Marine is up to its’ national tasks, but may develop into a prominent regional player, either if environment changes, brining in international cargo flows (transformation of Laem Chabang into regional cargo hub, or building Kra Canal); or if government and nation in general, will make the development of nation’s Merchant Marine one of nation’s priorities.

Apparently unmanned and abandoned ship drifted 58 kilometers until she grounded on a sandbank at 1142 kilometer mark. The ship was recognized as a very old newbuild, which broke off her moorings at Corrientes SA shipyard, where she waited to be completed for some 24 years. Keel was laid in 1993, in 2000 all works were frozen, and since then, the ship was patiently awaiting her fate at shipyard berth, until she got tired and decided to demonstrate somehow her protest.

6134,5071,GPS spoofing preps for worldwide sabotage ,"How else to explain spoofing in Russian waters? 
GPS spoofing is attracting more and more attention, as more and more people in industry are becoming aware of this new threat to shipping safety. One of the latest articles on spoofing was published on Sep 26 by The Maritime Executive, and I believe, one of the most comprehensive:
http://www.maritime-executive.com/article/gps-spoofing-patterns-discovered
Spoofing is still going on, in Russian waters. 
Even yesterday, the 25th of September, two vessels appeared at Sochi Airport, 20 kilometers (12 miles) from their actual positions near the Sochi harbor,” said Peled.

Now, Sochi is some kind of Putin’s Mar A Lago – his favorite place, with his favorite super luxury residences, and no less extravagant residences of his minions. The point is, no GPS meddling can happen in there, without full knowledge, and full support, of Russian State military and security bodies. Why do they do it? What’s the purpose of those, on the face of it, strikingly stupid tests? Why risk the safety of Russian famous resorts waters, by hampering merchant ships navigation with possible major accidents as consequences? 
I find the reason behind those tests to be crystal clear. Russian military, and Russian secret services, are steaming full ahead with preparations for worldwide sabotage, and GPS spoofing is obviously, a great opportunity to wreak a havoc on major seaways and in major sea ports, especially Western ports, US or European. 

Why should Kremlin do it? Again, the reason is crystal clear – clear for those, who know modern Russia and Putin’s regime, who know what’s all about. It’s all about power. Putin has to stick to power, when he loses power, he loses his freedom, his tremendous fortune and most probably, his life as well. Too many crimes were already committed, and are committed on every day basis. Economy is deteriorating and will be deteriorating, it’s more or less kept afloat by oil price, and be the oil price during last two years in $35-40 per barrel range, there won’t be any Russia by now, Russia as we know it. Russian Empire just wears itself out, its’ fall is the question of time and oil price. Putin badly needs chaos all around Russia, if for nothing else, then at least, for keeping tight rein on Russian people, by demonstrating them, how dangerous and unstable is the world around. 
GPS spoofing on major seaways is just one option to destabilize world economy, among many, but a very good, very promising option, which may, for example, plug some vital bottleneck, like say, Strait of Hormuz, even if temporarily. 

I’d say, beware GPS spoofing anywhere anytime, Russian commandos and saboteurs may surface, with portable spoofing devices, in any port, or along any major seaway, and switch these devices on. Right now though, they’re busy with calibrating and tuning devices and practices. Russia may task with sabotage some other States, or groups, or individuals, and after acts of sabotage, condemn those acts, and once again proclaim itself as a leader in fighting global terrorism, demanding immediate support from the West, and recognition of Russia’s superpower status (plus lifting of sanctions, plus recognizing Crimea as Russian territory, plus giving Russia free hand in dealing with Ukraine, plus many other things which can help Russian dying economy). 
There are other crazy States and organizations around, willing to use spoofing for carrying out sabotage acts, not only Russia. After all, it’s not all that complicated and costly. 

How to make shipping safe from this new threat? I don’t know. I guess, something can be done, like establishing Spoofing Early Detection and Warning Systems in major ports and along major seaways. Spoofing is not your hacking bogeyman story, you can’t protect your ship by protecting ship’s computers from omnipresent malevolent hackers. 
It’s different in character, and actually, it’s much easier threat to deal with, than computer hacking threat. Just switch from GPS and any other navigation positioning systems to good old methods of obtaining ship’s position, using radar, compass bearings and of course, paper charts, with able seaman at the helm, not an autopilot. We’re talking about navigating in coastal waters, it’s no big deal, as recently as 20 years ago we didn’t know any other ways to navigate, accidentally. 

I found the whole idea of compulsory ECDIS as exceptionally dangerous, from the very beginning. It’s not even the questions of reliability and officers losing their navigational skills. In our case, it’s the question of hostile environment – too many idiots and maniacs, be they individuals or States or organizations, are around, to feel anywhere safe enough. Criminal minds can, as of now, easily break in, and tamper with, navigational systems in coastal waters. The only thing they can’t tamper with or do anything about, is conventional methods of navigation – radars, compass bearings, even sextants, if that’s what it takes. But it won’t come to sextants – chances of causing major accident at high seas by tampering with navigational systems are zero, at least for the time being.

6268,5188,Floating bomb moving towards Canary Islands,"As of 0520 UTC Aug 22, bulk carrier CHESHIRE was some 110 nautical miles southwest of Hierro Island, Canary Islands. During last 24 hours, disabled and burning (?) vessel changed direction of her drift, and now is drifting towards Hierro Island at a rather high speed of 2.5-3.0 knots, driven most probably, by current, because weather and wind seem to be fair. 
 CHESHIRE is followed by three SAR tugs, RED SEA FOS, MIGUEL DE SERVANTES and VB HISPANIA, and Moroccan port tug  JACQUES 2. Tugs are moving in a box-like formation, with sides of the box being some 2-2.5 nautical miles long. Officials, in latest statements dated Aug 21, again said that the tugs are cooling burning vessel. Cooling with what, may I ask? SAR tugs pour water or foam on a burning vessel through their water cannons, which means dozens of meters distance from their object, not miles. If water cannons of deployed tugs don’t deliver water to their target in shells or missiles, official statements have to be considered, therefore, as doubtful. 
 There’s no detailed analysis yet, with assessment of risk of explosion, let alone expertise on explosion scale and possible consequences, including destructive dangers of a wave, generated by an explosion.
 That’s what I found just by two clicks in google:
 … ammonium nitrate has a potentially lethal downside: If it comes into contact with an open flame or other ignition source, it explodes violently. The explosive force occurs when solid ammonium nitrate decomposes very rapidly into two gases, nitrous oxide and water vapor.
 The deadliest industrial accident in U.S. history occurred in the port of Texas City, Texas, in 1947. A carelessly tossed cigarette started a fire aboard a ship carrying about 2,300 tons (2,086,000 kilograms) of ammonium nitrate packed in paper sacks. When the chemical exploded, it caused a blast powerful enough to knock people to the ground in Galveston, Texas, 10 miles (16 kilometers) away. The detonation also caused a chain reaction when a nearby ship, also carrying ammonium nitrate, exploded, setting fires at chemical tanks and oil refineries near the port. An estimated 581 people were killed in the disaster.
 But not all disasters involving ammonium nitrate are accidents: The fertilizer was packed into a rented truck and used by terrorists Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols to kill 168 people in the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City.
 https://www.livescience.com/28841-fertilizer-explosions-ammonium-nitrate.html
 I am not an expert in fire or explosives, but what’s going on board of CHESHIRE, doesn’t look like fire, it resembles active chemical reaction. If we’re to believe to ammonium nitrate expertise in numerous accessible materials, open flame causes ammonium nitrate explosion. 
 I didn’t dig deeper in order to, roughly, estimate, what are the equivalents of explosion of 40,000+ tons of ammonium nitrate, but it gives me creeps, frankly. 
 One more thing – I don’t trust any bureaucracy, of any nation or race or whatever. I have, kind of, countries-authorities-trustworthiness ranking list, a result of my vast experience of maritime accidents. Spain in my list is nowhere close to top, it’s definitely below average, better than Russia, a lot better than Iran, but few countries may claim less trust, than Russia or Iran, so it’s not a big deal. Tanker PRESTIGE disaster is just one reason, why Spain officials rank so low in my list of trust. I can give more.

6907,5741,"Russian air carrier ADMIRAL KUZNETSOV lost second jet fighter, again not in action","Russian Su-33 crashed in the Mediterranean while attempting to land on Kuznetsov aircraft carrier
Dec 05 2016
By David Cenciotti
Less than three weeks after losing a MiG-29, it looks like the Russian Navy has lost another aircraft during Admiral Kuznetsov operations: a Su-33 Flanker.
Military sources close to The Aviationist report that a Russian Navy Su-33 Flanker carrier-based multirole aircraft has crashed during flight operations from Admiral Kuznetsov on Saturday, Dec. 3.
According to the report, the combat plane crashed at its second attempt to land on the aircraft carrier in good weather conditions (visibility +10 kilometers, Sea State 4, wind at 12 knots): it seems that it missed the wires and failed to go around falling short of the bow of the warship.
The pilot successfully ejected and was picked up by a Russian Navy search and rescue helicopter.
Considered that on Nov. 14 a MiG-29K crashed while recovering to the aircraft carrier, if confirmed this would be the second loss for the air wing embarked on Admiral Kuznetsov in less than three weeks and a significant blow for the Russian Naval Aviation during its combat deployment off Syria.

Comment:
Even strictly pro-Kremlin Russian experts criticize ADMIRAL KUZNETSOV as being in very poor condition, outdated and initially, of a faulty design – jets can’t take off with full fuel load because the ship isn’t provided with catapult (former USSR and now Russia don’t have technology and know-how), their actual flight time over battle zone is restricted to, virtually, minutes. Plus faulty propulsion system, plus quite a number of other deficiencies. All of it taken together, air carrier ADMIRAL KUZNETSOV is posing a threat as potential ecological disaster, in case of major accident, with chance of such an accident being rather high. 
Sending air carrier to Syria was a pure political and military show, there’s absolutely no need in air carrier presence in Syrian waters from military point of view. Most part of air carrier’s wing had to be moved to a land base.

The tanker, which loaded at the Magellan Galena Park Terminal on June 28, first signaled it would be heading for Gibraltar, arriving in mid-July. The grade of diesel isn't known, nor the charterer.



Over the weekend, the vessel turned around mid-Atlantic, and is now signalling that it will arrive at Amuay Bay, Venezuela, within the next two days, according to the OPIS Tanker Tracker.



Diesel cargo prices in the Mediterranean and northwest Europe have already dropped 5% this month, OPIS calculations show. Prices ended the week at $413.75 per ton and $416.75 per ton, respectively.



Several Europe-bound diesel cargoes diverted to West Africa last week, including the Glencore-controlled Torm Louise, which arrived at the Togolese port of Lome on July 8.



Some eight cargoes of diesel totaling around 295,000 tons were loaded from the U.S. Gulf or Atlantic coast and are currently on the water and scheduled to arrive at a Mediterranean port between now and Aug. 4, according to data compiled from brokers, traders and vessel-tracking data. A further six ships each laden with about 38,000 tons are heading for northwest Europe.

9399,7817,Collision in Gulf of Suez – hit&run ship may be ballasting tanker ,"Egyptian fishing boat or vessel, named Badr Islam, with 40 or 45 people on board, was rammed by an unidentified big cargo vessel early in the morning Dec 14 in Gulf of Suez between Ras Ghareb and Tor Sinai port, some 50 kilometers from Hurghada port. 13 people were rescued, 13 dead bodies recovered, the rest are missing. Number of people on board of Badr Islam seems to be too big for a local fishing vessel, let alone boat. Probably Badr Islam was carrying passengers. Cargo vessel which struck Badr Islam didn’t stop and continued sailing. Firstly it was said, that the hit&run vessel was Kuwait-flagged or owned container ship en route from Italy to Jeddah. Later media said the vessel is Panama-flagged (maybe Hong Kong owned or operated) of a 220000 tons cargo capacity, which if true, leaves container ship out, it could be only a ballasting tanker, suezmax or VLCC. A big tanker could crash a small vessel, let alone boat, by a mere contact, brush, or even capsize it by waves in a very close approach. Media say collision took place in the dawn, meaning it wasn’t daylight, watch on bridge may simply miss small boat, both on radar (especially so if Badr Islam was a wooden boat) and visually. A collision jolt may not be felt at all. It’s too early to blame a cargo vessel for hit&run, without knowing all the details. Though most probably, authorities will do everything they can to make the cargo vessel guilty. 
The suspect vessel, according to Egyptian officials, is detained, it is understood she’s anchored off Safaga port.

   According to media, citing authorities, San Felipe was moored at the time of allision at Warf 20, while Al Riffa was under way, presumably leaving the port after completing cargo operation. Fire erupted on board of both vessels, on cargo decks in containers. San Felipe remained docked, fire reported to be quickly extinguished. Fire on board of Al Riffa developed into a major one, vessel was taken out of port.



   According to AIS and pics if look closely, it was the other way around – San Felipe was entering port and allided with berthed Al Riffa. Al Riffa remained docked with fire being quickly extinguished, while San Felipe had to be towed out of Westport, and not at a distance of 1 kilometer, as media said, but at a distance of 5 nautical miles, and anchored. At 0300 UTC Oct 29 vessels remained in the same position – Al Riffa docked in Westport, and San Felipe anchored on road, with at least two tugs nearby, meaning the fire is still on. No casualties or injures reported. No data on dangerous goods on board of San Felipe, though surely there are some.



   The whole story was twisted (including industry media, such as Maritime Executive and Hellenic Shipping) because first reports were made by journalists who looked at a picture where San Felipe with fire on board seems to be moored. Look closely – San Felipe is off pier, while on the left a piece of a bow may be seen – that should be Al Riffa.

 The accident happened on the river IJssel, about 110 kilometers east of the Dutch capital Amsterdam, when the vessel was on its way from Deventer, Netherlands to Cologne, Germany.



 There were no injures reported. Most of the passenger on board of the vessel were pensioners from Germany and Austria and they were safely helped to get off the 110-meter long BRITANNIA.



 As reported by police, due to the low level of water in the river the vessel hit something on the bottom and this probably caused a hole. The water ingress was very intensive and within a short time it reached 1,5 meter. With the help of powerful pumps the cruise ship was kept afloat. The divers are checking the ship’s bottom and are trying to repair the hole temporarily, then the vessel will be taken to the ship repair yard.",2014-06-23,10:32:53,nearly-200-passengers-evacuated-from-leaking-britannia-nethe,Accidents,"[{'id': '5722', 'attributes': {'assetId': 329847, 'assetName': 'BRITANNIA', 'assetType': 'vessel'}}, {'id': '142', 'attributes': {'assetId': 1766, 'assetName': 'AMSTERDAM', 'assetType': 'port'}}]",2014-06-23 10:32:53+00:00,[]

9864,10804,Tanker Delays Sees Dip in Europe’s June Jet Fuel Imports,"The estimated June tally of Europe-bound tankers laden with jet fuel has dropped over the past week as several ships anticipated to arrive this month appear delayed at loading ports in Asia and the Middle East Gulf.



   Jet fuel volumes into north-west Europe are forecast to be 1.328 million metric tons this month, according to the OPIS Tanker Tracker on FleetMon.com. Volumes into ports in the Mediterranean are seen at 428,000 metric tons, taking the entire regional inbound tally to 1.756 million tons.



   That’s about 265,000 tons less jet fuel that was anticipated last week for north west Europe. That’s partly because one vessel, the Odessa carrying 130,000 tons, appears to be a least a week delayed loading in Qatar, according to satellite tracking data and information from brokers compiled by OPIS.



   Mediterranean volumes for the month are also higher as a few were seen diverted from northwest Europe and several new cargoes came to light.



   The carry-over means that July volumes are already looking quite high, with the OPIS Tanker Tracker seeing 1.673 million metric tons, including the 130,000-ton cargo, the largest ever tracked, along with seven Long Range 2 tankers, the biggest ships to typically carry refined products. All is for northwest Europe so far.



   This week four tankers laden with about 160,000 metric of jet fuel are scheduled to arrive at ports in northwest Europe, or the U.K. for the week beginning June 15, according to the OPIS Tanker Tracker.  None are seen for the Med.



   The prior week from June 7-14 saw six tankers carrying 243,000 metric tons of jet fuel arriving in ports in the Mediterranean, while 180,000 tons on two ships were discharged in north west Europe.



   Tankers and cargoes scheduled to arrive from outside Europe in the next week include: Megacore Philomena (65,000 tons, Total); Amfitriti (90,000 tons BP); ETC Nefetari (40,000 tons, Valero); Mariann (65,000 tons, Kuwait Petroleum).



   A further two cargoes from BP may or may not make it within the time frame but their vessel speed can’t be determined: Cape Enterprise, carrying 90,000 tons, and the Gulf Castle with 60,000 tons.



The OPIS Tanker Tracker compiles information from traders and brokers, and FleetMon ship tracking to provide a real-time insight into Europe-bound refined products on tankers.

June 13 13 off Lome, Togo, was released, but the details
of the release are confused and contradictory. AIS signal reappeared on June 17
indicating that  the vessel crossed Gulf of Guinea
from Togo to Nigeria
coast. Vessel therefore, was released on June 17 or June 16. Nigerian military
made a following statement:


General Bata
Dembiro, a commander in Nigeria's
oil-producing Niger
Delta region, said the Nigerian navy and French marines stormed the vessel
after the hijackers seized it, but they took Benjamin Elan hostage to enable
them to escape. They released the other 14 crew, he said.


""The
rescued foreign ship worker was abducted in Togo
aboard an oil tanker and brought to Bayelsa state (in Nigeria) by
suspected kidnappers,"" Dembiro told Reuters by telephone.


The pirates
took the Frenchman to a small village in Bayelsa state in the delta, but youths
from the local community alerted the authorities, enabling them to mount a
rescue operation. The gang had fled before they arrived in the house, he said.


Does it mean Nigerian and French military stormed
tanker right after it was hijacked? Hardly so, judging from the vessel’s track.
Most probably, pirates were able to get what they were after from the start –
they stole the cargo, and fled the tanker shielding themselves by a French
crew, who later was thankfully, released, under unclear circumstances.

whay such stranhe movements, why vessel was adrift, why vessel didn’t steam to Port Harcourt immediatelt

The

unknown. The condition of the crew and other details are unknown, too. 


Vessel is
employed on a FEW1 service, operated by Maersk Line (Port Kelang-Tanjong
Pelepas-Lome-Onne -Douala -Walvis
 Bay -Port Kelang). It means vessel came to Gulf of Guinea
from Port Kelang, loaded with Asian consumer goods. It may be assumed, then,
that the pirates attacked and hijacked vessel in order to steal the goods, already
having the information about the goods they were after, and their location. 


If that’s
the case, then, it will be the first known case of hijacking a container ship
for stealing its’ goods in Gulf
 of Guinea. Surely, more

10734,8872,A new threat to seamen in Nigeria. Meet Mr Alex Davies.,"If a legal
battle to reclaim the stolen gasoil cargo from Anuket Emerald is successful, it
will be the first time this has happened and may signal a new way to cope with
piracy in West Africa, according to Stephenson
Harwood partner in marine insurance and international trade Alex Davies.


The pirates
seized the cargo documents, disabled the communications and the name of the
vessel was partly painted out so it read Rald. After the discharge of the
gasoil, this hijack could easily have followed the same pattern as those before
it. However, the second officer, who was brought up from the mess to assist
with navigation, caught a glimpse of the ship-to-ship transfer vessel and noted
it had an orange hull with a round funnel.


Intelligence
firm Gray Page pinpointed one such vessel that had discharged a gasoil cargo at
a jetty in Lagos.
The documents submitted to the jetty showed it had loaded from a vessel named
Ralb. Nigerian authorities were alerted and they seized the cargo.


Mr Davies
said there were things shipowners could be doing to aid detection in the
future.


“Swift
identification of the vessel is key so it can be arrested prior to discharge.
In this case, we were extremely lucky the second officer had a glimpse of the
STS vessel and that its characteristics were distinctive.”


Solutions
include a small hidden GPS transmitter with a dedicated power source and an
embedded time camera proving the identification of the bandit vessel.


These would
need to be fitted without the knowledge of the crew, as there is a risk that
pirates will torture seafarers until they reveal the location of any devices.


Gray Page
has recently attended a vessel in dry dock that was having this kit fitted.


Mr Davies
said this was evidence that owners were becoming more aware of these options.


Lloyd’s
List recently revealed the Economic Council of West African States has
provisionally agreed to allow foreign private maritime security companies to
operate in its territorial waters.


However,
from his experience in the area, Mr Davies said this move would be “completely
irrelevant as the small product tankers that are being targeted will not employ
armed guards”.


“The answer
here is to cut the revenue stream,” he said. 


“Our
experience with Anuket Emerald proves armed guards are not the answer. I am
bemused why more operators are not fitting this equipment already.”

Comment 


Mr Alex
Davies and the likes of him, including Gray Page firm, doom sailors to
tortures, because Nigerian pirates, who are no fools, will take a note of a new
device and surely, they’ll do their best to locate and destroy it. I don’t
think pirates will believe the crew has no idea where the device is hidden, at
the very least the crew may pinpoint most suitable spots for it. Stolen cargo
is worth millions, enough dough for criminals to start doing things they’ve
never been doin before, like setting ablaze superstructure or the whole vessel,
just to get rid of video and transmitter. Pirates don’t care what happens to
the crew, and why should they care more than Mr Davies, his partners and the
likes of them, who don’t give a damn for seamen.

10857,8975,The Alpha Cormorant platform partially evacuated after oil leak ,"The Alpha
Cormorant platform and the pipeline system it services were shut down as a
precaution after an oil leak in one of the legs on March 2 13, operator Abu
Dhabi National Energy Company (TAQA) said in a statement.


The company
said it had evacuated 71 of its 145 non-essential staff from the platform, and
that everyone was safe and well. Leak was contained in the leg with no release
of the hydro carbon into the sea. The leak was discovered during maintenance work
at 0940 GMT on Mar 2. 


Cormorant
Alpha, which was built in 1978, handles about 90,000 barrels per day of crude
oil, of which 42,600 are produced by TAQA.


The
Cormorant oilfield is located 161 kilometres (100 mi) north east of
Lerwick, Shetland, Scotland. Production started in
December 1979 from the Cormorant Alpha platform. This platform is a concrete
gravity platform of the Condeep type. It has four legs and storage capacity for
1 million barrels (160,000
 m3) of oil. The total sub-structure weight is 294,655
tonnes and it is designed to carry a topsides weight of 32,350 tonnes.


On 16
January 2013 and again on the 2nd of February 2013 a ""hydrocarbon
leak"" was reported by the BBC in one of the legs of the platform, closing
down the Brent System. No oil had been spilt into the sea. It was reported that
it had been contained in the leg of the platform.


It is said
that the life span of Cormorant A and Condeep type platforms is some 25 years.

10926,9038,"Missed Amurskaya crew could reach desolate island, still alive and hoping for rescue","Relatives of the crew of general cargo vessel Amurskaya, which sank in Okhotsk sea, presumably with all hands, appealed to authorities and media to start search and rescue operation on a Maly Shantar (Little Shantar) Island in Shantar Archipelago, south east Okhotsk sea. They sent to Maritime Bulletin photos of life saving equipment, including life jackets, which was found on the coastline of the island. Island’s area is some 100 sq. kilometers, island is uninhabited and covered by forest. Their appeal already reached the authorities, with absolutely no reaction except promise to collect the equipment for further check. No mentioning of the possibility of resuming search and rescue. Theoretically, people could still be alive and wait for rescue.

11052,9140,"Hijack of the Greek tanker Energy Centurion, Master’s report ","At 02:00 LT August 28 four armed pirates managed to board the vessel in bow area, taking 1 crew as a hostage and then moving to bridge, where they took over the control of the vessel. They ordered bosun to lower an accommodation ladder, and the rest of the gang boarded the vessel, totaling 10 armed criminals. 2 officer managed to send alarm signal before pirates captured the vessel. All the crew was summoned on the bridge and ordered to lay on a floor, faces down. Pirates hold the crew in such a position for 5 straight hours. Pirates disabled all the communication equipment and then ordered the crew to take the tanker to Nigerian waters. 
At around 02:40 Aug 29 a patrol boat of Togo Navy approached the tanker and ordered immediate stop, master refused and said he can’t stop the vessel. Boat fired at tanker during several minutes, then ceased fire and moved away. 
At 07:30 crew was summoned in crew’s mess room and kept there during all the time of captivity. During that time pirates once attacked one of the crew, fired a weapon and wounded in a leg another crew, a cadet. 
At 12:00 pirates ordered crew to repaint the name of the vessel with the new one Emty G.G.V, on both sides of the bow and on stern. 
At 21:00 a small oil vessel moored alongside Energy Centurion, at 01:06 Aug 29 pirates commenced the offloading, they managed to offload (steal) 3091 tons of fuel oil from tank No 2 starboard. The lightering vessel didn’t have name or number, or other IDs, all the staff on board of the vessel was of African origin, obviously professional and experienced in handling tanker’s cargo system, pumps and hoses, and in STS operations. After completing the operation, vessel unmoored and sailed in Nigerian waters direction. 
During next 36 hours pirates were busy communicating with somebody on the radio, discussing the place of rendezvous to be picked up. 
At 12:00 Aug 30 pirates forced the crew to lower into water life boat and put in a boat 16 canisters of diesel oil taken from engine room. Boat’s engine failed, crew had to lower another boat, and at 13:15 pirates left the vessel on the life boat. They were met by three boats, went into those boats and sailed in Nigeria waters towards shore. They looted the vessel and took with them all cash and valuables of the crew, from laptops to cloth and mobile phones. 
During all the time of captivity tanker was shadowed by a French Navy frigate, soon after pirates left French sailors boarded the tanker and rendered all assistance they including medical assistances to injured crewmen. Then another Navy ship approached the tanker, it was a Nigerian Navy ship demanding Energy Centurion to proceed to Lagos, Nigeria, for investigation, vessels’ survey and medical assistance. During the captivity there wasn’t any sign of Nigerian Navy presence. French frigate advised not to enter Nigerian waters and proceed to Lome, Togo. 
Tanker started moving towards Togo waters, the behaviour of Nigerian Navy ship turned so hostile that French frigate had to actually, place herself between tanker and Nigerian ship and escort tanker to safe waters.
